PREFACE 

In this book on the Einstein Theory of Relativity 

the attempt is made 

to introduce just enough 

mathematics 

to HELP 

and NOT to HINDER 

the lay reader/ 

"lay" can of course apply to 

various domains of knowledge 

perhaps then we should say: 

the layman in Relativity. 

Many "popular" discussions of 

Relativity, 

without any mathematics at all, 

have been written. 

But we doubt whether 

even the best of these 

can possibly give to a novice 

an adequate idea of 

what it is all about. 

What is very clear when expressed 

in mathematical language 

sounds "mystical" in 

ordinary language. 

On the other hand, 
there are many discussions, 
including Einstein's own papers, 
which are accessible to the 
experts only. 

vii 



We believe that 

there is a class of readers 

who can get very little out of 

either of these two kinds of 

discussion 

readers who know enough about 

mathematics 

to follow a simple mathematical presentation 

of a domain new to them, 

built from the ground up, 

with sufficient details to 

bridge the gaps that exist 

FOR THEM 

in both 

the popular and the expert 

presentations. 

This book is an attempt 
to satisfy the needs of 
this kind of reader.

THE SPECIAL THEORY 



I. INTRODUCTION. 

In order to appreciate 

the fundamental importance 

of Relativity, 

it is necessary to know 

how it arose. 

Whenever a "revolution 11 takes place, 

in any domain, 

it is always preceded by 

some maladjustment producing a tension, 

which ultimately causes a break, 

followed by a greater stability 

at least for the time being. 

What was the maladjustment in Physics 
in the latter part of the 19th century, 
which led to the creation of 
the "revolutionary 11 Relativity Theory? 

Let us summarize it briefly: 

It has been assumed that 

all space is filled with ether,* 

through which radio waves and light waves 

are transmitted 

any modern child talks quite glibly 

*This ether is of course NOT the chemical ether 
which surgeons use! 
ft is not a liquid, solid, or gas, 
it has never been seen by anybody, 
its presence is only conjectured 
because of the need for some medium 
to transmit radio and light waves. 

3 



about "wave-lengths 11 

in connection with the radio. 

Now, if there is an ether, 
does it surround the earth 
and travel with it, 
or does it remain stationary 
while the earth travels through it? 

Various known (acts* indicate that 

the ether does NOT travel with the earth. 

If, then, the earth is moving THROUGH the ether, 

there must be an "ether wind/' 

just as a person riding on a bicycle 

through still air, 

feels an air wind blowing in his face. 

And so an experiment was performed 
by Michelson and Morley (see p. 8) 
in 1887, 

to detect this ether wind/- 
and much to the surprise of everyone, 
no ether wind was observed. 

This unexpected result was explained by 

a Dutch physicist, Lorentz, in 1 895, 

in a way which will be described 

in Chapter II. 

The search for the ether wind 

was then resumed 

by means of other kinds of experiments.! 

*See the article M Aberration of Light", 

by A. S. Eddington, 

in the Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th ed. 
tSec the article "Relativity" 

by James Jeans, 

also in the Enc. Brit. 14th ed. 

4 



But, again and again, 

to the consternation of the physicists, 

no ether wind could be detected,' 

until it seemed that 

nature was in a "conspiracy' 1 

to prevent our finding this effect! 

At this point 

Einstein took up the problem, 

and decided that 

a natural "conspiracy 11 

must be a natural LAW operating. 

And to answer the question 

as to what is this law, 

he proposed his Theory of Relativity, 

published in two papers, 

one in 1905 and the other in 1915.* 

He first found it necessary to 

re-examine the fundamental ideas 

upon which classical physics was based, 

and proposed certain vital changes in them. 

He then made 

A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF 

MOST REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS 

from which he deduced his theory. 
So fruitful did his analysis prove to be 
that by means of it he succeeded in: 

(1) Clearing up the fundamental ideas. 

(2) Explaining the Michelson-Morley experiment 
in a much more rational way than 

had previously been done. 

*Both now published in one volume 
including also the papers by 
Lorentz and Minkowski, 
to which we shall refer later/ 
see SOME INTERESTING READING, page 324. 



(3) Doing away with 

other outstanding difficulties 
in physics. 

(4) Deriving a 

NEW LAW OF GRAVITATION 

much more adequate than the 

Newtonian one 

(See Part II.: The General Theory) 

and which led to several 

important predictions 

which could be verified by experiment; 

and which have been so verified 

since then. 

(5) Explaining 

QUITE INCIDENTALLY 

a famous discrepancy in astronomy 

which had worried the astronomers 

for many years 

(This also is discussed in 

The General Theory). 

Thus, the Theory of Relativity had 

a profound philosophical bearing 

on ALL of physics, 

as well as explaining 

many SPECIFIC outstanding difficulties 

that had seemed to be entirely 

UNRELATED, 

and of further increasing our knowledge 

of the physical world 

by suggesting a number of 

NEW experiments which have led to 

NEW discoveries. 

No other physical theory 

has been so powerful 

though based on so FEW assumptions. 

As we shall see. 



II. THE MICHELSON-MORLEY EXPERIMENT* 

On page 4 we referred to 

the problem that 

Michelson and Morley set themselves. 

Let us now see 

what experiment they performed 

and what was the startling result. 

In order to get the idea of the experiment 

very clearly in mind, 

it will be helpful first 

to consider the following simple problem, 

which can be solved 

by any boy who has studied 

elementary algebra: 

Imagine a river 

in which there is a current flowing with 

velocity v, 

in the direction indicated by the arrow: 



Now which would take longer 

for a man to swim 

From A to B and back to A , 

'Published in the 
Philosophical Magazine, vol. 24, (1887). 

8 



or 

from A to C and back to A , 

if the distances AB and AC are equal, 

AB being parallel to the current, 

and AC perpendicular to it? 

Let the man's rate of swimming in still water 

be represented by c / 

then, when swimming against the current, 

from A to 8 , 

his rate would be only c v f 

whereas, 

when swimming with the current, 

from 8 back to A , 

his rate would, of course, be c + v. 

Therefore the time required 

to swim from A to fi 

would be a/(c v), 

where a represents the distance AB ; 

and the time required 

for the trip from 8 to A 

would be a/(c + v). 

Consequently, 

the time for the round trip would be 

ti = a/(c - /) + a/(c + v) 
or ti = 2ac/(c 2 - v 2 ). 

Now let us see 

how long the round trip 

from A to C and back to A 

would take. 

If he headed directly toward C , 

the current would carry him downstream, 

and he would land at some point 

to the left of C in the figure on p. 8. 

Therefore, 

in order to arrive at C , 

9 



he should head for some point D 

just far enough upstream 

to counteract the effect of the current. 

In other words, 

if the water could be kept still 

until he swam at his own rate c 

from A to D , 

and then the current 

were suddenly allowed to operate, 

carrying him at the rate v from D to C 

(without his making any further effort), 

then the effect would obviously be the same 

as his going directly from A iojC 

with a velocity equal to Vc' 2 v 2 / 

as is obvious from the right triangle: 



ex \r 




Consequently/ 

the time required 

for the journey from A to C 

would be a/Vc^- v 2 , 

where a is the distance from A to C 

Similarly, 

in going back from C to A , 

it is easy to see that, 

10 



by the same method of reasoning, 



_ 

the time would again be a/Vc 2 v 2 . 
Hence the time for the round trip 
from A to C and back to A , 
would be _ 

fa = 2a/vV - y\ 

In order to compare ti and f- more easily, 
let us write ft for c/ V c 2 v 2 . 
Then we get: 

ti - 2a/3 2 /c 
and fa = 2a/3/c. 

Assuming that v is less than c , 

and c 2 v 2 being obviously less than c 2 , 

the Vc 2 v 2 is therefore less than c , 

and consequently ft is greater than 1 ^ 

(since the denominator 

is less than the numerator). 

Therefore t\ is greater than fa , 

that is, 

IT TAKES LONGER TO 

SWIM UPSTREAM AND BACK 

THAN TO SWIM THE SAME DISTANCE 

ACROSS-STREAM AND BACK. 

But what has all this to do 

with the Michelson-Morley experiment? 

In that experiment, 

a ray of light was sent from A to B: 

C-r 



^- 



HB 
11 



At 8 there was a mirror 

which reflected the light back to A , 

so that the ray of light 

makes the round trip from AioB and back, 

just as the swimmer did 

in the problem described above. 

Now, since the entire apparatus 

shares the motion of the earth, 

which is moving through space, 

supposedly through a stationary ether/ 

thus creating an ether wind 

in the opposite direction, 

(namely, the direction indicated above), 

this experiment seems entirely analogous 

to the problem of the swimmer. 

And, therefore/ as before/ 

ti = 2a0Yc 0) 

and ti = 2a|S/c. (2) 

Where c is now the velocity of light, 

and *2 is the time required for the light 

to go from A to C and back to A 

(being reflected from another mirror at Q. 

If/ therefore, 

ti and t> are found experimentally/ 

then by dividing (1) by (2), 

the value of /? would be easily obtained. 

And since = c/V c 2 -T 2 , 

c being the known velocity of light, 

the value of v could be calculated. 

That is, 

THE ABSOLUTE VELOCITY OF THE EARTH 

would thus become known. 

Such was the plan of the experiment. 

Now what actually happened? 

12 



The experimental values of t\ and ti 

were found to be the SAME, 

instead of ti being greater than ti \ 

Obviously this was a most disturbing result, 

quite out of harmony 

with the reasoning given above. 

The Dutch physicist, Lorentz, 

then suggested the following explanation 

of Michelson's strange result: 

Lorentz suggested that 

matter, owing to its electrical structure, 

SHRINKS WHEN IT IS MOVING, 

and this contraction occurs 

ONLY IN THE DIRECTION OF MOTION.* 

The AMOUNT of shrinkage 

he assumes to be in the ratio of 1/ff 

(where /3 has the value c/Vc 2 v 2 , as before). 

Thus a sphere of one inch radius 

becomes an ellipsoid when it is moving, 

with its shortest semi-axis 

(now only 1//3 inches long) 

*The two papers by Lorentz on this subject 
are included in the volume mentioned in 
the footnote on page 5. 
In the first of these papers 

Lorentz mentions that the explanation proposed here 
occurred also to Fitzgerald. 
Hence it is often referred to as 
the "Fitzgerald contraction" or 
the "Lorentz contraction* 1 or 
the "Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction. 11 



13 



in the direction of motion, 
thus: 




a erection 



Applying this idea 

to the Michelson-Morlcy experiment, 

the distance AB (= a) on p. 8, 

becomes a/jS , 

and ti becomes 2a/3/c / 

instead of 2a/3 2 /c , 

so that now ft = t2 , 

just as the experiment requires. 

One might ask how it is 

that Michelson did not 

observe the shrinkage? 

Why did not his measurements show 

that AB was shorter than AC 

(See the figure on p. 8)? 

The obvious answer is that 

the measuring rod itself contracts 

when applied to AB, 

so that one is not aware of the shrinkage. 

To this explanation 
of the Michelson-Morley experiment 
the natural objection may be raised 
that an explanation which is invented 
for the express purpose 

14 



of smoothing out a certain difficulty, 

and assumes a correction 

of JUST the right amount, 

is too artificial to be satisfying. 

And Poincare, the French mathematician/ 

raised this very natural objection. 

Consequently, 

Lorentz undertook to examine 

his contraction hypothesis 

in other connections, 

to see whether it is in harmony also 

with facts other than 

the Michelson-Morley experiment. 

He then published a second paper in 1904, 

giving the result of this investigation. 

To present this result in a clear form 

let us first re-state the argument 

as follows: 



vt 




T 



Consider a set of axes, X and Y, 

supposed to be fixed in the stationary ether, 

and another set X' and Y' , 

attached to the earth and moving with it, 

15 



with velocity v , as indicated above 
Let X 7 move along X, 
and V" move parallel to V. 

Now suppose an observer on the earth, 

say Michelson, 

is trying to measure 

the time it takes a ray of light 

to travel from A to B , 

both A and 8 being fixed points on 

the moving axis X r . 

At the moment 

when the ray of light starts at A 

suppose that Y and Y f coincide, 

and A coincides with D / 

and while the light has been traveling to B 

the axis V has moved the distance vt , 

and B has reached the position 

shown in the figure on p. 1 5, 

t being the time it takes for this to happen. 

Then, if DB = x and AB = x', 

we have x' = x vt. (3) 

This is only another way 

of expressing what was said on p. 9 

where the time for 

the first part of the journey 

was said to be equal to a/(c v).* 

And, as we saw there, 

this way of thinking of the phenomenon 

did NOT agree with the experimental facts. 

Applying now the contraction hypothesis 

*Since we are now designating a by x', 
we have x'/(c v) = t , or x = ct vf. 
But the distance the light has traveled 
is x , 

and x = ct, 
consequently x' = x - vt is equivalent to a/(c v) = t. 

16 



proposed by Lorentz, 

x r should be divided by /3, 

so that equation (3) becomes 

x7/3 = x - vt 
or x' = (x - vt). (4) 

Now when Lorentz examined other fads, 

as stated on p. 1 5, 

he found that equation (4) 

was quite in harmony with ail these facts, 

but that he was now obliged 

to introduce a further correction 

expressed by the equation 



(5) 



where /3 , t , v , x , and c 

have the same meaning as before 

But what is t?! 

Surely the time measurements 

in the two systems are not different: 

Whether the origin is at D or at A 

should not affect the 

TIME-READINGS. 

In other words, as Lorentz saw it, 

t' was a sort of "artificial 11 time 

introduced only for mathematical reasons, 

because it helped to give results 

in harmony with the facts. 

But obviously t had for him 

NO PHYSICAL MEANING. 

As Jeans, the English physicist, puts it: 

"If the observer could be persuaded 

to measure time in this artificial way, 

setting his clocks wrong to begin with 

and then making them gain or lose permanently, 

the effect of his supposed artificiality 

17 



would just counterbalance 

the effects of his motion 

through the ether 11 !* 

Thus, 

the equations finally proposed by Lorentz 

are: 

x' = (x - vt) 



z' = 



Note that 

since the axes attached to the earth (p. 1 5) 

are moving along the X-axis, 

obviously the values of y and z 

(z being the third dimension) 

are the same as / and z , respectively. 

The equations just given 

are known as 

THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION, 

since they show how to transform 

a set of values of x , y , z , t 

into a set x', y, z, t' 

in a coordinate system 

moving with constant velocity v, 

along the X-axis, 

with respect to the 

unprimed coordinate system. 

And, as we saw, 

whereas the Lorentz transformation 

really expressed the facts correctly, 

it seemed to have 

NO PHYSICAL MEANING, 

*See the article on Relativity in the 
Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th edition. 

19 



and was merely 

a set of empirical equations. 

Let us now see what Einstein did. 



III. RE-EXAMINATION OF THE 
FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS. 

As Einstein regarded the situation, 

the negative result of 

the Michelson-Morley experiment, 

as well as of other experiments 

which seemed to indicate a "conspiracy" 

on the part of nature 

against man's efforts to obtain 

knowledge of the physical world (see p. 5), 

these negative results, 

according to Einstein, 

did not merely demand 

explanations of a certain number 

of isolated difficulties, 

but the situation was so serious 

that a complete examination 

of fundamental ideas 

was necessary. 

In other words, 

he felt that there was something 

fundamentally and radically wrong 

in physics, 

rather than a mere superficial difficulty. 

And so he undertook to re-examine 

such fundamental notions as 

our ideas of 

LENGTH and TIME and MASS. 

His exceedingly reasonable examination 

20 



is most illuminating, 
as we shall now see. 

But first let us remind the reader 

why length, time and mass 

are fundamental, 

Everyone knows that 

VELOCITY depends upon 

the distance (or LENGTH) 

traversed in a given TIME, 

hence the unit of velocity 

DEPENDS UPON 

the units of LENGTH and TIME. 

Similarly, 

since acceleration is 

the change in velocity in a unit of time, 

hence the unit of acceleration 

DEPENDS UPON 

the units of velocity and time, 

and therefore ultimately upon 

the units of LENGTH and TIME. 

Further, 

since force is measured 

by the product of 

mass and acceleration, 

the unit of force 

DEPENDS UPON 

the units of mass and acceleration, 

and hence ultimately upon 

the units of 

MASS, LENGTH and TIME, 

And so on. 

In other words, 

all measurements in physics 

depend primarily on 

MASS, LENGTH and TIME. 
That is why 

21 



the system of units ordinarily used 

is called the "C.G.S." system,^ 

where C stands for "centimeter" 

(the unit of length), 

G stands for "gram" (the unit of mass), 

and 5 stands for "second" (the unit of time)/ 

these being the fundamental units 

from which all the others are derived. 

Let us now return to 

Einstein's re-examination of 

these fundamental units. 

Suppose that two observers 

wish to compare their measurements of time. 

If they are near each other 

they can, of course/ look at each other's watches 

and compare them. 

If they are far apart/ 

they can still compare each other's readings 

BY MEANS OF SIGNALS, 

say light signals or radio signals/ 

that is/ any "electromagnetic wave* 1 

which can travel through space. 

Let us/ therefore/ imagine that 

one observer/ f , is on the earth/ 

and the other/ 5 / on the sun/ 

and imagine that signals are sent 

as follows: 

By his own watch/ 5 sends a message to 

which reads "twelve o'clock/" 

f receives this message 

say/ eight minutes later;* 

*Since the sun is about 93 000 000 miles 
from the earth, 

and light travels about 186 000 miles per second, 
the time for a light (or radio) signal 
to travel from the sun to the earth/ 
is approximately eight minutes. 

22 



now, if his watch agrees with that of S , 

it will read f< 12:08 n 

when the message arrives. 

then sends back to 5 

the message "12:08," 

and, of course, 

5 receives this message 8 minutes later, 

namely, at 12:16. 

Thus 5 will conclude, 

from this series of signals, 

that his watch and that of f 

are in perfect agreement. 

But let us now imagine 

that the entire solar system 

is moving through space, 

so that both the sun and the earth 

are moving in the direction 

shown in the figure: 




without any change in 

the distance between them. 

Now let the signals again be sent 

as before: 

S sends his message "1 2 o'clock," 

but sincejf js moving awayjrom jjta 

IRelatter wiffnot reaclTE in 8 minutes, 

but will take some longer time 

to overtake f , 

Say, 9 minutes. 

23 



If Fs watch is in agreement with that of 5 , 

it will read 12:09 

when the message reaches him, 

and accordingly sends a return message/ 

reading "12:09." 

Now 5 is traveling toward this message/ 

and it will therefore reach him 

in LESS than 8 minutes, 

say, in 7 minutes. 

Thus S receives Fs message 

at 1 2:1 6, / 

just as before. 

Now if 5 and F are both 

UNAWARE of their motion 

(and, indeed, 

we are undoubtedly moving 

in ways that we are entirely unaware of, 

so that this assumption 

is far from being an imaginary one.) 

5 will not understand 

why Fs message reads 

"12:09" instead of "12:08," 

and will therefore conclude 

that Fs watch 

must be fast. 

Of course, this is only 

an apparent error in Fs watch, 

because, as we know, 

it is really due to the motion, 

and not at all 

to any error in Fs watch. 

It must be noted, however, 

that this omniscient "we" 

who can see exactly 

what is "really" going on in the universe, 

does not exist, 

and that all human observers 

24 



are really in the situation 

in which 5 is, 

namely, 

that of not knowing 

about the motion in question, 

and therefore 

being OBLIGED to conclude 

that 's watch is wrong! 

And therefore, 

5 sends the message 

telling him that 

if sets his clock back one minute, 

then their clocks will agree. 

In the same way, 

suppose that other observers, 

j4,B,C,ctc., 

all of whom are at rest WITH RESPECT TO 

5 and , 

all set their clocks to agree with that of S , 

by the same method of signals described above. 

They would all say then 

that all their clocks are in agreement. 

Whether this is absolutely true or not, 

they cannot tell (see above), 

but that is the best they can do. 

Now let us see what will happen 

when these observers wish 

to measure the length of something. 

To measure the length of an object, 

you can place it, 

say, on a piece of paper, 

put a mark on the paper at one end of the object, 

and another mark at the other end, 

then, with a ruler, 

find out how many units of length there are 

25 



between the two marks. 

This is quite simple provided that 

the object you are measuring and the paper 

are at rest (relatively to you). 

But suppose the object is 

say, a fish swimming about in a tank? 

To measure its length while it is in motion, 

by placing two marks on the walls of the tank, 

one at the head, and the other at the tail, 

it would obviously be necessary 

to make these two marks 

SIMULTANEOUSLY - 

for, otherwise, 

if the mark 6 is made at a certain time, 



C 



/ 

V- 




B 



then the fish allowed to swim 

in the direction indicated by the arrow, 

and then the mark at the head 

is made at some later time, 

when it has reached C, 

then you would say that 

the length of the fish 

is the distance BC, 

which would be a fish-story indeed! 

Now suppose that our observers, 

after their clocks are all in agreement (see p. 25), 

undertake to measure 

the length of a train 

26 



which is moving through their universe 

with a uniform velocity. 

They send out orders that 

at 1 2 o'clock sharp, 

whichever observer happens to be 

at the place where 

the front end of the train, A' 9 

arrives at that moment, 

to NOTE THE SPOT; 

and some other observer, 

who happens to be at the place where 

the rear end of the train, B , 

is at that same moment, 

to put a mark at THAT spot. 

Thus, after the train has gone, 

they can, at their leisure, 

measure the distance between the two marks, 

this distance being equal to 

the length of the train, 

since the two marks were made 

SIMULTANEOUSLY, namely at 12 o'clock, 

their clocks being all 

in perfect agreement with each other. 

Let us now talk to the people on the train. 

Suppose, first, 

that they are unaware of their motion, 

and that, according to them, 

A f B f ^, t etc., are the ones who are moving, 

a perfectly reasonable assumption. 

And suppose that there are two clocks on the train, 

one at A', the other at B', 

and that these clocks 

have been set in agreement with each other 

by the method of signals described above. 

Obviously the observers A , B , C, etc., 

wit! NOT admit that the clocks at A and B' 

27 



arc in agreement with each other, 

since they "know" that the train is in motion, 

and therefore the method of signals 

used on the moving train 

has led to an erroneous setting 

of the moving clocks (see p. 25). 

Whereas the people on the train, 

since they "know" that 

A, B , C, etc./ are the ones who are moving, 

claim that it is the clocks 

belonging to A, 8, C, etc., 

which were set wrong. 

What is the result of this 

difference of opinion? 

When the clocks of A and B , say, 

both read 12 o'clock, 

and at that instant A and B 

each makes a mark at a certain spot, 

then A and B claim, of course, 

that these marks were made 

simultaneously; 

but the people on the train do not admit 

that the clocks of A and 8 

have been properly set, 

and they therefore claim that 

the two marks were 

NOT made SIMULTANEOUSLY, 

and that, therefore, 

the measurement of the LENGTH of the train 

is NOT correct. 

Thus, 

when the people on the train 

make the marks 

simultaneously, 

as judged by their own clocks, 

the distance between the two marks 

28 



will NOT be the same as before. 

Hence we see that 

MOTION 

prevents agreement in the 

setting of clocks, 

and, as a consequence of this, 

prevents agreement in the 

measurement of LENGTH! 

Similarly, 

as we shall see on p. 79, 

motion also affects 

the measurement of mass 

different observers obtaining 

different results 

when measuring the mass of the same object. 

And since, 

as we mentioned on p. 21, 

all other physical measurements 

depend upon 

length, mass, and time, 

it seems that 

therefore there cannot be agreement 

in any measurements made 

by different observers 

who are moving with different velocities! 

Now, of course, 

observers on the earth 

partake of the various motions 

to which the earth is subject 

the earth turns on its axis, 

it goes around the sun, 

and perhaps has other motions as wefl. 

Hence it would seem that 

observations made by people on the earth 

29 



cannot agree with 

those taken from 

some other location in the universe, 

and are therefore 

not really correct 

and consequently worthless! 

Thus Einstein's careful and reasonable examination 

led to the realization that 

Physics was suffering from 

no mere single ailment, 

as evidenced by the 

Michelson-Morley experiment alone, 

but was sick from head to foot! 

Did he find a remedy? 
HE DID! 

IV. THE REMEDY. 

So far, then, we see that 

THE OLD IDEAS REGARDING 

THE MEASUREMENT OF 

LENGTH, TIME AND MASS 

involved an "idealistic" notion of 

"absolute time 11 

which was supposed to be 

the same for all observers, 

and that 

Einstein introduced 

a more PRACTICAL notion of time 

based on the actual way of 

setting clocks by means of SIGNALS. 

This led to the 

DISCARDING of the idea that 

31 



the LENGTH of an object 

is a (act about the object 

and is independent of the person 

who does the measuring/ 

since we have shown (Chapter III.) 

that the measurement of length 

DEPENDS UPON 

THE STATE OF MOTION OF THE MEASURER. 

Thus two observers, 

moving relatively to each other 

with uniform velocity/ 

DO NOT GET THE SAME VALUE 

FOR THE LENGTH OF A GIVEN OBJECT. 

Hence we may say that 

LENGTH is NOT a FACT about an OBJECT, 

but rather a 

RELATIONSHIP between 

the OBJECT and the OBSERVER. 

And similarly for TIME and MASS (Ch. III.). 

In other words, 

from this point of view 

it is NOT CORRECT to say: 

x' = x vt 

as Michelson did* (see p. 16, equation (3) ), 

since this equation implies that 

the value of x' 

is a perfectly definite quantity, 

*We do not wish to imply that 
Michelson made a crude error 
ANY CLASSICAL PHYSICIST 
would have made the same statement, 
for those were the prevailing ideas 
thoroughly rooted in everybody's mind, 
before Einstein pointed out 
the considerations discussed in Ch. III. 

32 



namely, 

THE length of the arm AB of the apparatus 

in the Michelson-Morley experiment 

(See the diagram on p. 1 5). 

Nor is it correct to assume that 



(again as Michelson did) 
for two different observers, 
which would imply that 
both observers agree in their 
time measurements. 

These ideas were contradicted by 
Michelson's EXPERIMENTS, 
which were so ingeniously devised 
and so precisely performed. 

And so Einstein said that 

instead of starting with such ideas, 

and basing our reasoning on them, 

let us rather 

START WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA, 

and see to what relationships 

they will lead us, 

relationships between 

the length and time measurements 

of different observers. 

Now what experimental data 

must we take into account here? 

They are: 

FACT (1): It is impossible 

to measure the "ether wind," 

or, in other words, 

it is impossible to detect our motion 

relative to the ether. 

This was clearly shown by the 

33 



Michelson-Morley experiment, 

as well as by all other experiments 

devised to 

measure this motion (see p. 5). 

Indeed, this is the great 

"conspiracy* 1 

that started all the trouble, 

or, as Einstein prefers to see it, 

and most reasonably so, 

THIS IS A FACT. 
FACT (2): The velocity of light is the same 

no matter whether the source of light 

is moving or stationary. 

Let us examine this statement 

more fully, 

to see exactly what it means. 

To do this, 

it is necessary to remind the reader 

of a few well-known facts: 

Imagine that we have two trains, 

one with a gun on the front end, 

the other with a source of sound 

on the front end, 

say, a whistle. 

Suppose that the velocity, u , 

of a bullet shot from the gun, 

happens to be the same as 

the velocity of the sound. 

Now suppose that both trains 

are moving with the same velocity, v , 

in the same direction. 

The question is: 

How does the velocity of a bullet 

(fired from the MOVING train) 

relatively to the ground, 

compare with 

34 



the velocity of the sound 
that came from the whistle 
on the other MOVING train, 
relatively to the medium/ the air, 
in which it is traveling? 
Are they the same? 

No! 

The velocity of the bullet, 
RELATIVELY TO THE GROUND, 

is v + u , 

since the bullet is now propelled forward 

not only wiih its own velocity, u , 

given to it by the force of the gun, 

but, in addition, 

has an inertia! velocity, v , 

which it has acquired from 

the motion of the train 

and which is shared by 

all objects on the train. 

But in the case of the sound wave 

(which is a series of pulsations, 

alternate condensations and rarefactions of the air 

in rapid succession), 

the first condensation formed 

in the neighborhood of the whistle, 

travels out with the velocity u 

relatively to the medium, 

regardless as to whether 

the train is moving or not. 

So that this condensation 

has only its own velocity 

and does NOT have the inertia! velocity 

due to the motion of the train, 

the velocity of the sound 

depending only upon the medium 

35 



(that is, whether it is air or water/ etc., 
and whether it is hot or cold, etc.), 
but not upon the motion of the source 
from which the sound started. 

The following diagram 
shows the relative positions 
after one second/ 
in both cases: 

CASE I. 

Both trains at rest. 

Tram u jt. 



-ft. 



CASE II. 

Both trains moving with velocity v. 




v 

UfV 




u 4*. 

Thus/ in Case II., 
the bullet has moved 
u + v feet in one second 

36 



from the starting point, 

whereas the sound has moved only u feet 

from the starting point/ 

in that one second. 

Thus we see that 

the velocity of sound is u feet per second 

relatively to the starting point, 

whether the source remains stationary 

as in Case I., 

or follows the sound, as in Case II. 

Expressing it algebraically, 

x = ut 

applies equally well for sound 

in both Case I. and Case II., 

x being the distance 

FROM THE STARTING POINT. 

Indeed, this fact is true of ALL, WAVE MOTION, 

and one would therefore expect 

that it would apply also to LIGHT. 

As a matter of FACT, 

it DOES, 

and that is what is meant by 

FACT (2) on p. 34. 

Now, as a result of this, 

it appears, 

by referring again to the diagram on p. 36, 

that 

relatively to the MOVING train (Case II.) 

we should then have, 

for sound 

x' = (u - v)t 

x being the distance 

from T to the point where 

the sound has arrived after time t. 

37 



From which, by measuring x ' , u , and t, 

we could then calculate v , 

the velocity of the train. 

And, similarly, for light 

using the moving earth 

instead of the moving train, 

we should then have, 

as a consequence of FACT (2) on p 34, 

x' = (c - v)t 

where c is the velocity of light 

(relatively to a stationary observer 

out in space) 

and v is the velocity of the earth 

relatively to this stationary observer 

and hence 

the ABSOLUTE velocity of the earth. 

Thus we should be able 

to determine v. 

But this contradicts FACT (1), 

according to which 

it is IMPOSSIBLE to determine v. 

Thus it APPEARS that 

FACT (2) requires 

the velocity of light 

RELATIVELY TO THE MOVING EARTH 

to be c v (see diagram on p. 36), 

whereas FACT (1) requires it to be c.* 

*FACT (1) may be re-stated as follows: 
The velocity of light 

RELATIVE TO A MOVING OBSERVER 

(For example, an observer 

on the moving earth) 

must be c, and NOT c v t 

for otherwise, 

he would be able to find v , 

which is contrary to fact. 

38 



And so the two facts 
contradict each other! 
Or, stating it another way: 







If, in one second, 

the earth moves from E to E' 

while a ray of light, 

goes from the earth to L , 

then 

FACT(1) requires that 

E'/. be equal to c ( = 1 86,000 miles) 

while FACT (2) requires that 

EL be equal to c / 

Now it is needless to say that 
FACTS CAN NOT CONTRADICT 
EACH OTHER! 

Let us therefore see how, 
in the light of the discussion in Ch. III. 
FACTS (1) and (2) can be shown to be 
NOT contradictory. 



V. THE SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY 

We have thus seen that 

according to the facts, 

the velocity of light 

IS ALWAYS THE SAME, 

39 



whether the source of light 

is stationary or moving 

(See FACT (2) on p. 34), 

and whether the velocity of light 

is measured 

relatively to the medium in which it travels, 

or relatively to a MOVING observer 

(See p. 37). 

Let us express these (acts algebraically, 

for two observers, K and K f , 

who are moving with uniform velocity 

relatively to each other, 

thus: 

K writes x = ct , (6) 

and K' writes x' = ct', (7) 

both using 

THE SAME VALUE FOR 

THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT, 

namely, c , 

and each using 

his own measurements of 

length, x and x', 

and time, t and t', respectively. 

It is assumed that 

at the instant when 

the rays of light start on their path, 

K and K' are at the SAME place, 

and the rays of light 

radiate out from that place 

in all directions. 

Now according to equation (6), 

K , who is unaware of his motion through the ether 

(since he cannot measure it), 

may claim that he is at rest, 

and that in time, t , 

40 



K' must have moved to the right, 

as shown in the figure below/ 

and that/ in the meantime, 

the light/ 

which travels out in all directions from K , 

has reached all points at 

the distance ct from K , 

and hence 

all points on the circumference 

of the circle having the radius ct. 




But W claims that he is the one 
who has remained stationary/ 
and that K / on the contrary, 
has moved TO THE LEFT/ 
furthermore that the light travels out 
from K f as a center, 
instead of from K\ 
And this is what he means 
when he says 

x' = ct'. 

How can they both be right? 

41 



We may be willing 

not to take sides 

in their controversy regarding the question as to 

which one has moved 

K' to the right or K to the left 

because either leads to the same result. 

But what about the circles? ,-? 

They cannot possibly have both K and K 

as their centers! ' 

One of them must be right and the other wrong. 

This is another way of stating 

the APPARENT CONTRADICTION BETWEEN 

FACTS (1) and (2) (see p. 39). 

Now, at last, we are ready 
for the explanation. 

Although K claims that 

at the instant when 

the light has reached the point C(p. 41), 

it has also reached 

the point A f on the other side, 

still, 

WE MUST REMEMBER THAT 

when K says 

two events happen simultaneously 

(namely, the arrival of the light at C and A), 

K' DOES NOT AGREE 

THAT THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUS (see p. 28). 

So that when 

K says that 

the arrival of the lisht at C and B 

(rather than at C and A) 

ARE SIMULTANEOUS, 

his statement 

DOES NOT CONTRADICT THAT OF K, 

since K and K' 

DO NOT MEAN THE SAME THING 
42 



WHEN THEY SAY 
"SIMULTANEOUS-. 11 

for 

K's clocks at C and A 

do not agree with K'*s clocks at C and A. 

Thus when the light arrives at A , 

the reading of K*s clock there 

is exactly the same as that of K's clock at C 

(K having set all clocks in his system 

by the method of signals described on p. 25), 

while 

K n s clock at A i 

when the light arrives there/ 

reads a LATER TIME than his clock at C 

when the light arrived at C, 

so that K maintains that 

the light reaches A 

LATER than it reaches C, 

and NOT at the SAME instant, 

as K claims. 

Hence we see that 

they are not really contradicting each other, 

but ihat they are merely using 

two different systems of clocks, 

such that 

the clocks in each system 

agree with each other alright, 

but the clocks in the one system 

have NOT been set 

in agreement with the clocks 

in the other system (see p. 28). 

That is, 

If we take into account 

the inevitable necessity of 

using signals 

in order to set clocks which are 

43 



at a distance from each other, 

and that the arrivals of the signals 

at their destinations 

are influenced by 

our state of motion, 

of which we are not aware (p. 24), 

it becomes clear that 

THERE IS NO REAL CONTRADICTION HERE, 

but only a difference of description 
due to INEVITABLE differences 
in the setting of 
various systems of clocks. 

We now see 

in a general qualitative way, 

that the situation is 

not at all mysterious or unreasonable, 

as it seemed to be at first. 

But we must now find out 

whether these considerations, 

when applied QUANTITATIVELY, 

actually agree with the experimental facts. 

And now a pleasant surprise awaits us. 



VI. THE RESULT OF APPLYING 
THE REMEDY. 

In the last chapter we saw that 
by starting with 

two fundamental FACTS (p. 34), 
we reached the conclusion 
expressed in the equations 

x = ct (6) 

and x' = ct' (7) 

44 



which are graphically represented on p. 41, 

and we realized that these equations 

are NOT contradictory, 

(as they appear to be at first), 

if we remember that there is 

a difference in the setting of the clocks 

in the two different systems. 

We shall derive, now, from (6) and (7), 

relationships between the measurements 

of the two observers, K and K f . 

And all the mathematics we need for this 

is a little simple algebra, 

such as any high school boy knows.. 

From (6) and (7) we get 

x - ct =0 
and x' - ct' = 0. 

Therefore 

x' - ct' - X(x - ct) (8) 

where X is a constant. 

Similarly, in the opposite direction, 

x' + ct' = /x (x + ct) (9) 

H being another constant. 

By adding and subtracting (8) and (9) 

we get: x' = ax - feet (10) 

and ct' = act-fex (11) 

where a = (X -f- ju)/2 and b = (X - ju)/2. 

Let us now find the values of a and fe 

in terms of v 

(the relative velocity of K and /C ), 

and c , the velocity of light. 

45 



This is done in the following 

ingenious manner:* 

From (10) 

when x = , 

then x = bet/ a / 

but x' = at the point K'\ 



(12) 



T 


T 


X 


K 


K' 


* 



And x in this case is 

the distance from K to K! , 

that is, 

the distance traversed/ in time t 

by K f moving with velocity v 

relatively to K. 

Therefore x = vt. 

Comparing this with (1 2), we get 

v = be/a. 

Let us now consider the situation 

from the points of view of K and K'. 

Take K first: 

For the time t - , 

/Cgetsx' - ax (from (10)), 

or x = x'/a. 

Hence K says that 

*See Appendix I in "Relativity 11 by Einstein, 
Pub. by Peter Smith, N. Y. (1931). 

46 



(13) 



(14) 



to get the "true" value, x, 

K ; should divide his x by a/ 

in particular, 

ifx'-1, 

K says that K"s unit of length 

is only 1/a of a "true" unit. 

But K, 

att' = 0,usins(11) 

says 

fex=act (15) 

and since from (10), 



(1 5) becomes 

6x ac(ax x')/6c f 

62^2 f 

"x ax ax , 

from which 

x' = a(1 - 6 2 /a 2 )x. (16) 

And since 6/a = y/c from (1 3), 

(16) becomes 

x f = a(1 - vVc-)x. (17) 

In other words, 

K' says: 

In order to get the "true" value, x', 

K should multiply his x by 

a(1 - v 2 /c). 

In particular, 

ifx- 1, 

then K says that 

f('s unit is really a(1 vr/c 2 ) units long. 

Thus 

47 



each observer considers that 

his own measurements 

are the "true" ones, 

and advises the other fellow 

to make a "correction.* 1 

And indeed, 

although the two observers, K and /(', 

may express this "correction* 1 

in different forms, 

still 

the MAGNITUDE of the "correction" 

recommended by each of them 

MUST BE THE SAME, 

since it is due in both cases 

to the relative motion, 

only that each observer attributes this motion 

to the other fellow. 

Hence, from (14) and (1 7) we may write 

1/a = a(1 - v s /c 2 ).* 
Solving this equation for a , we get 

a = c/V?~-v*. 

*Note that this equation is 
NOT obtained by 

ALGEBRAIC SUBSTITUTION 

from (14) and (17), 

but is obtained by considering that 

the CORRECTIONS advised by K and K' 

in (14) and (17), respectively, 

must be equal in magnitude 

as pointed out above. 

Thus in (14) K says: 

"You must multiply your measurement by 1/a", 

whereas in (1 7) K' says: 

"You must multiply your measurement by a (1 

and since these correction factors 
must be equal 



48 



Note that this value of a 

is the same as that of /? on p. 1 1 . 

Substituting in (10) 

this value of a 

and the value fee = ay from (13), 

we get 

x' = 0x - |8vf 
or x' = /3(x-rt) (18) 

which is the first of the set of equations 
of the Lorenti transformation on page 19! 

Furthermore, 

from (1 8) and / x = ct 
\x' = ct' 
we get 

ct' = P(ct - vt) 
or t' = /3(t - vt/c). 

Or, since t = x/c, 

t' = /3(t - vx/c 2 ), (19) 

which is another of the equations 
of the Lorentz transformation! 
That the remaining two equations 
y' = y and z' = z also hold, 
Einstein shows as follows: 
Let K and /C' each have a cylinder 
of radius r, when at rest 
relatively to each other, 

and whose axes coincide with the X (X 7 ) axis/ 
Now, unless / = y and z r = z, 
K and K f would each claim that 
his own cylinder is OUTSIDE the other fellow's! 

We thus see that 

the Lorentz transformation was derived 

by Einstein 

(quite independently of Lorentz), 

NOT as a set of empirical equations 

49 



devoid of physical meaning, 

but, on the contrary, 

as a result of 

a most rational change in 

our ideas regarding the measurement of 

the fundamental quantities 

length and time. 

And so, according to him, 

the first of the equations of the 

Lorentz transformation, 

namely, 

x' - /3(x - vt) 
is so written 

NOT because of any real shrinkage, 
as Lorentz supposed, 
but merely an apparent shrinkage, 
due to the differences in 

the measurements made by K and /C * (see p. 45). 
And Einstein writes 

t' = /3(t - vx/c 2 ) 

NOT because it is just a mathematical trick 

WITHOUT any MEANING (see p. 19) 

but again because 

it is the natural consequence of 

the differences in the measurements 

of the two observers. 

And each observer may think 

that he is right 

and the oiher one is wrong/ 

and yet 

each one, 

by using his own measurements, 

arrives at the same form 

*This shrinkage, it will be remembered, 
occurs only in the direction of motion (see p. 1 3). 

50 



when he expresses a physical fact, 

as, for example, 

when K says x = ct 

and K f says x' = ct' , 

they are really agreeing as to 

the LAW of the propagation of light. 

And similarly, 

if K writes any other law of nature, 

and if we apply 

the Lorentz transformation 

to this law, 

in order to see what form the law takes 

when it is expressed in terms of 

the measurements made by /C 7 , 

we find that 

the law is still the same, 

although it is now expressed 

in terms of the primed coordinate system. 

Hence Einstein says that 

although no one knows 

what the "true" measurements should be, 

yet, 

each observer may use his own measurements 

WITH EQUAL RIGHT AND EQUAL SUCCESS 

in formulating 

THE LAWS OF NATURE, 

or, 

in formulating the 

INVARIANTS of the universe, 

namely, the quantities which remain unchanged 

in spite of the change in measurements 

due to the relative motion of K and K . 

Thus, we can now appreciate 
Einstein's Principle of Relativity: 
"The laws by which 

52 



the states of physical systems 

undergo change, 

are not affected 

whether these changes of state be referred 

to the one or the other 

of two systems of coordinates 

in uniform translatory motion. " 

Perhaps some one will ask 

"But is not the principle of relativity old/ 

and was it not known long before Einstein? 

Thus a person in a train 

moving into a station 

with uniform velocity 

looks at another train which is at rest, 

and imagines that the other train is moving 

whereas his own is at rest. 

And he cannot find out his mistake 

by making observations within his train 

since everything there 

is just the same as it would be 

if his train were really at rest. 

Surely this fact, 

and other similar ones, 

must have been observed 

long before Einstein?" 

In other words, 

RELATIVELY to an observer on the train 

everything seems to proceed in the same way 

whether his system (i.e., his train) 

is at rest or in uniform* motion, 

and he would therefore be unable 

*0f course if the motion is not uniform, 
but "jerky", 

things on the train would jump around 
and the observer on the train 
would certainly know 
that his own train was not at rest. 

53 



to detect the motion. 

Yes, this certainly was known 

long before Einstein. 

Let us see what connection it has 

with the principle of relativity 

as stated by him: 

Referring to the diagram on p. 36 

we see that 

a bullet fired from a train 

has the same velocity 

RELATIVELY TO THE TRAIN 

whether the latter is moving or not, 

and therefore an observer on the train 

could not detect the motion of the train 

by making measurements on 

the motion of the bullet. 

This kind of relativity principle 

is the one involved 

in the question on page 53, 

and WAS known long before Einstein. 

Now Einstein 
EXTENDED this principle 
so that it would apply to 
electromagnetic phenomena 
(light or radio waves). 

Thus, 

according to this extension of 
the principle of relativity, 
an observer cannot detect 
his motion through space 
by making measurements on 

the motion of ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES. 

But why should this extension 

be such a great achievement 

why had it not been suggested before? 

54 



BECAUSE 

it must be remembered that 

according to fact (2) see p. 39, 



o 






- 









whereas, 

the above-mentioned extension of 

the principle of relativity 

requires that EL should be equal to c 

(compare the case of the bullet on p. 36). 

In other words, 

the extension of the principle of relativity 

to electromagnetic phenomena 

seems to contradict fact (2) 

and therefore could not have been made 

before it was shown that 

fundamental measurements are merely "local" 

and hence the contradiction was 

only apparent, 

as explained on p. 42; 

so that the diagram shown above 

must be interpreted 

in the light of the discussion on p. 42. 

Thus we see that 

whereas the principle of relativity 

as applied to MECHANICAL motion 

(like that of the bullet) 

was accepted long before Einstein, 

the SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE EXTENSION 

of the principle 

to electromagnetic phenomena 

was accomplished by him. 

55 



This extension of the principle, 

for the case in which 

K and K' move relatively to each other 

with UNIFORM velocity, 

and which has been discussed here/ 

is called 

the SPECIAL theory of relativity. 

We shall see later 

how Einstein generalized this principle 

STILL FURTHER, 

to the case in which 

K and K? move relatively to each other 

with an ACCELERATION, 

that is, a CHANGING velocity. 

And, by means of this generalization/ 

which he called 

the GENERAL theory of relativity, 

he derived 

A NEW LAW OF GRAVITATION/ 

much more adequate even than 

the Newtonian law, 

and of which the latter 

is a first approximation. 

But before we can discuss this in detail 

we must first see 

how the ideas which we have 

already presented 

were put into a 

remarkable mathematical form 

by a mathematician named Minkowski. 

This work 

was essential to Einstein 

in the further development of his ideas/ 

as we shall see. 



56 



VII. THE FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE-TIME 
CONTINUUM. 

We shall now see 

how Minkowski* put Einstein's results 

in a remarkably neat mathematical form, 

and how Einstein then utilized this 

in the further application of his 

Principle of Relativity, 

which led to 

The General Theory of Relativity, 

resulting in a 

NEW LAW OF GRAVITATION 

and leading to further important consequences 

and NEW discoveries. 

It is now clear 

from the Lorentz transformation (D. 1 9) 

that 

a length measurement, x , 

in one coordinate system 

depends upon BOTH x and t in another, 

and that 

t' also depends upon BOTH x and t. 

Hence^ 

instead of regarding the universe 

as being made up of 

Space, on the one hand, 

and Time, quite independent of Space, 

there is a closer connection 

between Space and Time 

than we had realized. 

In other words, 

*See collection of papers mentioned in 
footnote on p. 5. 

57 



that the universe is NOT a universe of points, 
with time flowing along 
irrespective of the points, 
but rather, 
this is 

A UNIVERSE OF EVENTS, - 

everything that happens, 
happens at a certain place 
AND at a certain time. 

Thus, every event is characterized 

by the PLACE and TIME of its occurrence. 

Now, 

since its place may be designated 

by three numbers, 

namely, 

By the x, y, and z co-ordinates of the place 

(using any convenient reference system), 

and since the time of the event 

needs only one number to characterize it, 

we need in all 

FOUR NUMBERS 

TO CHARACTERIZE AN EVENT, 

just as we need 

three numbers to characterize 

a point in space. 

Thus we may say that 

we live in a 

four-dimensional world. 

This does NOT mean 

that we live in four-dimensional Space, 

but is only another way of saying 

that we live in 

A WORLD OF EVENTS 

rather than of POINTS only, 

and it takes 

58 



FOUR numbers to designate 
each significant element, 
namely, each event. 

Now if an event is designated 

by the four numbers x, y, z, f , 

in a given coordinate system, 

the Lorentz transformation (p. 19) 

shows how to find 

the coordinates x', y', z', t', 

of the same event, 

in another coordinate system, 

moving relatively to the first 

with uniform velocity. 

In studying "graphs 11 

every high school freshman learns 

how to represent a point 

by two coordinates, x and y, 

using the Cartesian system of coordinates, 

that is, 

two straight lines 

perpendicular to each other. 

Now, we may also use 

another pair of perpendicular axes, 

X' and Y' (in the figure on the next page), 

having the same origin, , as before, 

and designate the same point by x and y' 

in this new coordinate system. 

When the high school boy above-mentioned 

goes to college, 

and studies analytical geometry, 

he then learns how to find 



60 



/ H 

.-. fl 
't^- 




\ 



\ 
\ 
J 
6 \ 



the relationship between 

the primed coordinates 

and the original ones/ 

and finds this to be expressed as follows:* 



anc 



x = x'cosfl - /sine ) 
y = x'sinfl + /cos0 / 



where 6 is the angle through which 
the axes have been revolved, 
as shown in the figure above. 

The equations (20) remind one somewhat 
of the Lorentz transformation (p. 19), 
since the equations of 



*Seep. 310. 



61 



(20) 



the Lorentz transformation 

also show how to go 

from one coordinate system to another. 

Let us examine the similarity 

between (20) and the 

Lorentz transformation 

a little more closely, 

selecting from the 

Lorentz transformation 

only those equations involving x and t , 

and disregarding those containing y and z, 

since the latter remain unchanged 

in going from one coordinate system to the other. 

Thus we wish to compare (20) with: 

/ x' - |8(x - vt) 
t t' - /3(t - vx/c 2 ). 

Or, if, for simplicity, we take c = 1, 

that is, taking 

the distance traveled by light in one second, 

as the unit of distance, 

we may say that 

we wish to compare (20) with 



x' = /3(x- vt)) 
t' = P(t- vx)f 



Let us first solve (21) for x and t , 
so as to get them more nearly 
in the form of (20). 
By ordinary algebraic operations,* 

*And temembering that 
we are taking c = 1, 
and that therefore 



62 



we get 

x = fat + vt') ) 
and t = j8(t' + vx') } ' 

Before we 90 any further, 

let us linger a moment 

and consider equations (22): 

Whereas (21) represents /(speaking, 

and saying to K '. 

"Now you must divide x by /3, 

before you can get the relationship 

between x and x' that you expect, 

namely, equation (3) on p. 16; 

in other words, your x' has shrunk 

although you don't know it." 

In (22), 

it is K f speaking, 

and he tells K the same thing, 

namely that K must divide x by /? , 

to get the "true" x , 

which is equal to x 1 + vt'. 

Indeed, 

this is quite in accord 

with the discussion in Chapter VI., 

in which it was shown that 

each observer 

gives the other one 

precisely the same advice! 

Note that the only difference 

between (21) and (22) is that 

+ y becomes v 
in going from one to the other. 



63 



And this is again quite in accord 

with our previous discussion 

since each observer 

believes himself to be at rest, 

and the other fellow to be in motion, 

only that one says: 

"You have moved to the right*' (+ v), 

whereas the other says: 

"You have moved to the left*' ( v). 

Otherwise, 

their claims are precisely identical; 

and this is exactly what 

equations (21) and (22) show so clearly. 

Let us now return to the comparison 
of (22) and (20): 
Minkowski pointed out that 

if, in (22), 

t is replaced by IT (where / = V 1 ), 
and t' by IT', 
then (22) becomes: 

x = /3(x' + ivr') 

IT = /?(// + VX') 

or 

/ X = frt' + 
\ IT - I/V + 

Or (by multiplying the second equation by *- i): 

x = /3x' + i/3vr' 
T = /3r' - fivx'. 
Finally, 



64 



substituting* cos0 for ]8 and sin0 for i 
these equations become 

( x = x'cosfl r'sinfl ) 
\ r = x'sinfl + r'cosfl j 



EXACTLY like (20)! 

In other words, 

ff K observes a certain event 

and finds that 

the four numbers necessary 

to characterize it (see p. 58) 

are x , y , z , r , 

and K ', observing the SAME event, 

finds that in his system 

the four numbers 

are x', y, i ', r f , 

then the form (23) 

of the Lorentz transformation 

shows that 

to go from one observer's coordinate system 

to the other 

it is merely necessary 

to rotate the first coordinate system 

through an angle 0, in the x , r plane, 

without changing the origin, 

*Since is greater than 1 (see p. 11) 
must be an imaginary angle: 
See p. 25 of "Non-Euclidean Geometry/' 
another book by H. G. and L. R. Lieber. 
Note that sin 2 + cos 2 = 1 
holds for imaginary angles 
as well as for real ones/ 
hence the above substitutions are legitimate, 
thus 2 + (- i/5v) 2 = F - V = 2 (1 - v 2 ) - 
since /3 2 = 1/(1 - v 2 ), 
r being taken equal to 1 (see p. 62). 

65 



thus: 




(remembering that y = y f and z = z'). 
And since we took (p. 65) 

p = cos e 

and ifiv = sin 

then tan = iv. 

That is, 

the magnitude of the angle 

depends upon v , 

the relative velocity of K and K f . 

And since, from (23), 

/ x 2 = (x 7 ) 2 cos 2 - 2xYsin0 cosfl + (rj sin 2 
( r 2 = (x 7 ) 2 sin 2 + 2x / r / $infl costf + (r') 2 cos 2 fl 

then, obviously, 

x 2 + r 2 = (x') 2 + (rj 
or (since y = / and z = z 7 ), 

x 2 + y 2 + z 2 + r 2 = (xT + (y? + (z 7 ) 2 + (rj 
66 



Now, it will be remembered 
from Euclidean plane geometry, 







that x* + y 2 represents 

the square of the distance 

between O and A , 

and similarly, 

in Euclidean three-dimensional space, 



)C + y 2 



also represents 



the square of the distance between two points. 

Thus, also, 

x 2 + y 2 + r + r 2 represents 

the square of the "interval 1 * between two EVENTS, 

in our four-dimensional world (see p. 58). 

And, 

just as in plane geometry 

the distance between two points 

remains the same 

whether we use 

the primed or the unprimed 

coordinate systems (see p. 61), 

that is, 

*> + y 2 = (xj + (yj 

67 



(although x does NOT equal x', 
and y does NOT equal /). 
So, in three dimensions, 

x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = (x7 + (yj + (zj 

and, similarly, 

as we have seen on p. 66, 

the "interval" between two events, 

in our four-dimensional 

space-time world of events, 

remains the same, 

no matter which of the two observers, 

K or /C', 

measures it. 

That is to say, 

although K and K' 

do not agree on some things/ 

as, for example/ 

their length and time measurements, 

they DO agree on other things: 

(1) The statement of their LAWS (see p, 51) 

(2) The "interval" between events, 
Etc. 

In other words/ 

although length and time 

are no longer INVARIANTS, 

in the Einstein theory, 

other quantities, 

like the space-time interval between two events, 

ARE invariants 

in this theory. 

These invariants are the quantities 

68 



which have the SAME value 
for all observers,* 
and may therefore be regarded 
as the realities of the universe. 

Thus, from this point of view, 

NOT the things that we see or measure 

are the realities, 

since various observers 

do not get the same measurements 

of the same objects, 

but rather 

certain mathematical relationships 

between the measurements 

(Like x 2 + y 2 + z 2 + r 2 ) 

are the realities, 

since they are the same 

for all observers.* 

We shall see, 

in discussing 

The General Theory of Relativity, 

how fruitful 

Minkowski's view-point of a 

four-dimensional Space-Time World 

proved to be. 



VIII. SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE 
THEORY OF RELATIVITY. 

We have seen that 

if two observers, K and K f , move 

relatively to each other 

*Ail observers moving relatively to each other 
with UNIFORM velocity (see p. 56). 

69 



with constant velocity, 

their measurements of length and time 

are different; 

and, on page 29, 

we promised also to show 

that their measurements of mass are different. 

In this chapter we shall discuss 

mass measurements, 

as well as other measurements which 

depend upon 

these fundamental ones. 

We already know that if an object moves 

in a direction parallel to 

the relative motion of K and K , 

then the Lorentz transformation 

gives the relationship 

between the length and time measurements 

of K and K'. 

We also know that 

in a direction PERPENDICULAR to 

the relative motion of K and K f 

there is NO difference in the 

LENGTH measurements (See footnote on p. 50), 

and, in this case, 

the relationship between the time measurements 

may be found as follows: 

For this PERPENDICULAR direction 
Michelson argued that 
the time would be 

t 2 = 2a/c (seep. 12). 

Now this argument 

is supposed to be from the point of view 

of an observer who 

DOES take the motion into account, 

70 



and hence already contains 

the "correction" factor /}/ 

hence, 

replacing to by t' f 

the expression t' = 2a/3/c 

represents the time 

in the perpendicular direction 

as K tells K it SHOULD be written. 

Whereas K , in his own system, 

would, of course, write 

t = 2a/c 
for his "true" time, t. 

Therefore 

t' = |8f 

gives the relationship sought above, 
from the point of view of K. 

From this we see that 

a body moving with velocity u 

in this PERPENDICULAR direction, 

will appear to K and K to have 

different velocities: 

Thus, 

Since u = d/t and u' = c/'/f' 

where c/ and </' represent 

the distance traversed by the object 

as measured by K and K f f respectively; 

and since J = </' 

(there being NO difference in 

LENGTH measurements in this direction 

see p. 70) 

and t f = j8t , as shown above, 

then i/ = c///3t = (1//3)u. 

Similarly, 

since a = u/t and a' = u /t f 

71 



where a and a' are the 
accelerations of the body, 
as measured by K and /(', respectively, 
we find that 



In like manner 

we may find the relationships 

between various quantities in the 

primed and un primed systems of co-ordinates, 

provided they depend upon 

length and time. 

But, since there are THREE basic units in Physics 

and since the Lorentz transformation 

deals with only two of them, length and time, 

the question now is 

how to get the MASS into the game. 

Einstein found that the best approach 

to this difficult problem was via the 

Conservation Laws of Classical Physics. 

Then, just as the old concept of 

the distance between two points 

(three-dimensional) 

was "stepped up" to the new one of 

the interval between two events 

(four-dimensional), (see p. 67) 

so also the Conservation Laws 

will have to be "stepped up" into 

FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE-TIME. 

And, when this is done 

an amazing vista will come into view! 

CONSERVATION LAWS OF 
CLASSICAL PHYSICS: 
(1) Conservation of Mass: this means that 
no mass can be created or destroyed, 

72 



but only transformed from one kind to another. 

Thus, when a piece of wood is burned, 

its mass is not destroyed, for 

if one weighs all the substances into which 

it is transformed/ together with the ash 

that remains, this total weight is the 

same as the weight of the original wood. 

We express this mathematically thus: ASm = o 

where 2 stands for the SUM, so that 2m 

is the TOTAL mass, and A, as usual, 

stands for the "change", so that 

ASm = o says that the change in 

total mass is zero, which is the 

Mass Conservation Law in very 

convenient, brief, exact form! 

(2) Conservation of Momentum: this says that 
if there is an exchange of momentum 
(the product of mass and velocity, mv) 
between bodies, say, by collision, the 
TOTAL momentum BEFORE collision 

is the SAME 

as the TOTAL after collision: A2mv = o. 

(3) Conservation of Energy: which means that 
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but 
only transformed from one kind to another. 
Thus, in a motor, electrical energy is 
converted to mechanical energy, whereas 

in a dynamo the reverse change takes place. 
And if, in both cases, we take into account 
the part of the energy which is 
transformed into heat energy, by friction, 
then the TOTAL energy 
BEFORE and AFTER the transformation 
is the SAME, thus: A2E = o. 
Now, a moving body has 

73 



KINETIC energy, expressible thus: 

When two moving, ELASTIC bodies collide, 

there is no loss in kinetic energy of 

the whole system, so that then we have 

Conservation of Kinetic Energy: AS^mv 2 = o 

(a special case of the more general Law); 

whereas, for inelastic collision, where 

some of the kinetic energy is changed into 

other forms, say heat, then AZ^r/nv 2 5^ o. 

Are you wondering what is the use of all this? 

Well, by means of these Laws, the most 

PRACTICAL problems can be solved,* 

hence we must know what happens to them 

in Relativity Physics! 

You will see that they will lead to: 

(a) NEW Conservation Laws for 
Momentum and Energy, which are 
INVARIANT under 

the Lorentz transformation, 
and which reduce, for small v, J 
to the corresponding Classical Laws 
(which shows why those Laws worked 
so well for so long!) 

(b) the IDENTIFICATION of 
MASS and ENERGY! 

Hence mass CAN be destroyed as such 
and actually converted into energy! 
Witness the ATOMIC BOMB (see p. 318). 

See, for example, "Mechanics for Students of Physics and 
Engineering'* by Crew and Smith, Macmillan Co., 
pp. 238-241 

Remembering that the "correction 1 * factor, ft, is equal to 
c/V c 2 y 2 , you see that, when v is small relatively to 
the velocity of! i grit, c, thus making v 2 negligible, then 
= 1 and hence no "correction* 1 is necessary. 

74 



Thus the Classical Mass Conservation Law 
was only an approximation and becomes 
merged into the Conservation of Energy Lawl 

Even without following the mathematics of 
the next few pages/ you can already 
appreciate the revolutionary IMPORTANCE of 
these results, and become imbued with 
the greatest respect for the human MIND 
which can create all this and 
PREDICT happenings previously unknown! 
Here is MAGIC for you! 

Some readers may be able to understand 
the following "stepping up" process now, 
others may prefer to come back to it 
after reading Part II of this book: 

The components of the velocity vector 
in Classical Physics, are: 

cfx/c/t, c/y/c/t, c/z/c/t. 

And, if we replace x, y, z by xi, X2, xs, 
these become, in modern compact notation: 

JxjJt 0-1,2,3). 

Similarly, the momentum components are: 
m.c/x,/c/t (/= 1,2,3) 

so that, for n objects, 

the Classical Momentum Conservation Law is: 



=o 



(/= 1,2,3) (24) 



But (24) is NOT an invariant under 
the Lorentz transformation; 

75 



the corresponding vector which IS 
so invariant is: 



=o 0=1,2,3,4) (25) 

where s is the interval between two events. 

and it can be easily shown * that c/s = c/t//3, 

c/s being, as you know, itself invariant 

under the Lorentz transformation. 

Thus, in going from 3-dimensional space 

and 1 -dimensional absolute time 

(i.e. from Classical Physics) 

to 4-dimensional SPACE-TIME, 

we must use s for the independent variable 

instead of t. 

Now let us examine (25) which is so easily 

obtained from (24) when we learn to speak the 

NEW LANGUAGE OF SPACE-TIME! 

Consider first only the first 3 components of (25): 

Then A{33m.c/xi/c/s} = o (i = 1,2,3) (26) 

is the NEW Momentum Conservation Law, 

since, for large v, it holds whereas (24) does NOT/ 

and, for small v, which makes /3 = 1 and c/s = c/f , 

(26) BECOMES (24), as it should! 

And now, taking the FOURTH component of (25), 

namely, m.cta/cfs or mc.dtjds (see p. 233) 

and substituting c/t//J for </s, _ 

we get mci8 which is mc.c/Vc 2 v 2 or 

mc/Vl - v 2 /c 2 or mc(1 - v 2 /c 2 ) " * . (27) 

Expanding, by the binomial theorem, 



/, , 1 v 2 , 3 v 4 , \ 

we get cp + j.^ + j-^ + . . -j, 

Since c/s 2 = cVt 2 - (c/x 2 + c/y 2 + c/z 2 ) (see p. 233). 
dividing by c/t 2 and taking c = 1 , we get 
(c/s /c/0 2 = 1 - v 2 anc/ c/s/c/t = A/1 - y 2 = 1 //S 

76 



which/ (or small v(neglecting terms after v 2 ), 

(1 vr\ 
1 + r ~ 2 I. (28) 

And, multiplying by c, we get me 2 + ^mv 2 . 
Hence, approximately, 

A{Z(roc 2 + |/nv 2 )} = o. (29) 

Now, if m is constant, as for elastic collision, 

then A2/nc 2 = o and therefore also A2(J?mv 2 ) = o 

which is the Classical Law of the 

Conservation of Kinetic Energy for 

elastic collision (see p. 74); 

thus (29) reduces to this Classical Law 

for small v, as it should! 

Furthermore, we can also see from (29) that 

for INELASTIC collision, for which 

A{2|mv 2 } ^o (see p. 74) 

hence also A2mc 2 ^ o or 

c being a constant, c 2 A2m ^ o 

which says that, for inelastic collision, 

even when v is small, 

any loss in kinetic energy is compensated for 

by an increase in mass (albeit small) 

a new and startling consequence for 

CLASSICAL Physics itself! 

Thus, from this NEW viewpoint we realize that 

even in Classical Physics 

the Mass of a body is NOT a constant but 

varies with changes in its energy 

(the amount of change in mass being 

too small to be directly observed)! 

Taking now (27) instead of (28), we shall 

not be limited to small v/ 

77 



and, multiplying by c as before, 
we get A{2mc 2 /3j = o for the 

NEW Conservation Law of Energy, 

which/ together with (25), is invariant under the 

Lorentz transformation, and which, 

as we saw above, reduces to 

the corresponding Classical Law, For small v. 

Thus the NEW expression for the ENERGY 

of a body is: f = /nc 2 /3, which, 

for v = o , gives fo = me 2 , (30) 

showing that 

ENERGY and MASS are 

one and the same entity 

instead of being distinct, as previously thought! 

Furthermore, 

even a SMALL MASS^m, 

is equivalent to a LARGE amount of ENERGY, 

since the multiplying factor is c 2 , 

the square of the enormous velocity of light! 

Thus even an atom is equivalent to 

a tremendous amount of energy. 

Indeed, when a method was found (see p. 318) 

of splitting an atom into two parts 

and since the sum of these two masses is 

less than the mass of the original atom, 

you can see from (30) that 

this loss in mass must yield 

a terrific amount of energy 

(even though this process does not transform 

the entire mass of the original atom into energy). 

Hence the ATOMIC BOMB! (p. 318) 

Although this terrible gadget has 

stunned us all into the realization 

of the dangers in Science, 

let us not forget that 

78 



the POWER behind it 

is the human MIND itself. 

Let us therefore pursue our examination of 

the consequences of Relativity, 

the products of this REAL POWER! 

In 1901 (before Relativity), 

Kaufman*, experimenting with 

fast moving electrons, 

found that 

the apparent mass of a moving electron 

is greater than that of one at rest 

a result which seemed 

very strange at the time! 

Now, however, with the aid of (26) 

we can see 

that his result is perfectly intelligible, 

and indeed accounts for it quantitatively! 

Thus the use of c/s instead of c/t, 

(where c/s = dtj(3) brings in 

the necessary correction factor, j3, for large v , 

not via the mass but is inherent in our 

NEW RELATIVITY LANGUAGE, 

in which c/x r /c/s replaces the idea of 

velocity, c/Xj/c/t, and makes it 

unnecessary and undesirable to think in terms of 

mass depending upon velocity. 

Many writers on Relativity replace 

c/s by c(t/j8 in (26) and write it: 

A{Sinj8.(/Xj/(/t} = o, putting the 

correction on the m. 
Though this of course gives 

* Gcscll. Wiss. Gott. Nachr., Math.-Phys., 1901 K1-2, 
p. 143, and 1902, p. 291. 

79 



the same numerical result, 
it is a concession to 

CLASSICAL LANGUAGE, 

and Einstein himself does not like this. 
He rightly prefers that since we are 
learning a NEW language (Relativity) 
we should think directly in that language 
and not keep translating each term 

into our old CLASSICAL LANGUAGE 

before we "feel 11 its meaning. 

We must learn to "feel" modern and talk modern. 

Let us next examine 
another consequence of 
the Theory of Relativity: 

When radio waves are transmitted 

through an "electromagnetic field/ 1 

an observer K may measure 

the electric and magnetic forces 

at any point of the field 

at a given instant. 

The relationship between 

these electric and magnetic forces 

is expressed mathematically 

by the well-known Maxwell equations 

(see page 311). 

Now, if another observer, K'/ 

moving relatively to K 

with uniform velocity, 

makes his own measurements 

on the same phenomenon, 

and, according to 

the Principle of Relativity, 

uses the same Maxwell equations 

in his primed system, 

80 



it is quite easy to show* that 
the electric force 

is NOT an INVARIANT 

for the two observers/ 
and similarly 

the magnetic force is also 
NOT AN INVARIANT 
although the relationship between 
the electric and magnetic forces 
expressed in the 
MAXWELL EQUATIONS 

has the same form for 

both observers; 

just as, on p. 68, 

though x does NOT equal x' 

and y does NOT equal y f 

still the formula for 

the square of the distance between two points 

has the same form 

in both systems of coordinates. 

Thus we have seen that 
the SPECIAL Theory of Relativity, 
which is the subject of Part I (see p. 56), 
has accomplished the following: 

(1) It revised the fundamental physical concepts. 

(2) By the addition of 

ONLY ONE NEW POSTULATE, 

namely, 

the extension of 

the principle of relativity 

* See Einstein's first paper (pp. 52 & 53) in 
the bo>k mentioned in the footnote on p. 5. 

81 



to ELECTROMAGNETIC phenomena* 

(which extension was made possible 

by the above-mentioned revision 

of fundamental units see p. 55), 

it explained many 

ISOLATED experimental results 

which baffled the 

pre-Einsteinian physicists: 

As, for example, 

the Michelson-Morley experiment, 

Kaufman's experiments (p. 79), 

and many others (p. 6). 

(3) It led to the merging into 
ONE LAW 

of the two, formerly isolated, principles^ 
of the Conservation of Mass and 
the Conservation of Energy. 

In Part II 

we shall see also how 

the SPECIAL Theory served as a 

starting point for 

the GENERAL THEORY, 

*The reader may ask: 
"Why call this a postulate? 
(s it not based on Facts?" 
The answer of course is that 
a scientific postulate must be 
BASED on facts, 

but it must 30 further than the known facts 
and hold also for 

facts that are still TO BE discovered. 
So that it is really only an ASSUMPTION 
(a most reasonable one, to be sure 
since it agrees with facts now known), 
which becomes strengthened in the course of time 
if it continues to agree with NEW facts 
as they are discovered. 

82 



which, again, 

by means of only 

ONE other assumption, 

led to FURTHER NEW IMPORTANT RESULTS, 

results which make the theory 

the widest in scope 

of any physical theory. 



IX. A POINT OF LOGIC AND A SUMMARY 

It is interesting here 

to call attention to a logical point 

which is made very clear 

by the Special Theory of Relativity. 

In order to do this effectively 

let us first list and number 

certain statements, both old and new, 

to which we shall then refer by NUMBER: 

(1) It is impossible for an observer 

to detect his motion through space (p. 33). 

(2) The velocity of light is 

independent of the motion of the source (p. 34). 

(3) The old PRE-EINSTEINIAN postulate 
that time and length measurements 

are absolute, 

that is, 

are the same for all observers. 

(4) Einstein's replacement of this postulate 
by the operational fact (see p. 31) 
that 

time and length measurements 

83 



are NOT absolute, 

but relative to each observer. 

(5) Einstein's Principle of Relativity (p. 52). 

We have seen that 

(1)and(2) 

are contradictory IF (3) is retained 

but are NOT contradictory IF 

(3) is replaced by (4). (Ch. V.) 

Hence 

it may NOT be true to say that 

two statements MUST be 

EITHER contradictory or NOT contradictory, 

without specifying the ENVIRONMENT 

Thus, 

in the presence of (3) 

(1) and (2) ARE contradictory, 

whereas, 

in the presence of (4), 

the very same statements (1) and (2) 

are NOT contradictory.* 

We may now briefly summarize 

the Special Theory of Relativity: 

(1), (2) and (4) 

are the fundamental ideas in it, 

and, 

since (1) and (4) are embodied in (5) 7 

then (2) and (5) constitute 

the BASIS of the theory. 

Einstein gives these two 
as POSTULATES 

*Similarly 

whether two statements are 
EQUIVALENT or not 
may also depend upon the environment 
(ee p. 30 of "Non-Euclidean Geometry" 
bv H. G. and L R. Lieber). 

84 



from which he then deduces 

the Lorentz transformation (p. 49) 

which gives the relationship 

between the length and time measurements] 

of two observers moving relatively to each other 

with uniform velocity, 

and which shows that 

there is an intimate connection 

between space and time. 

This connection was then 

EMPHASIZED by Minkowslo, 

who showed that 

the Lorentz transformation may be regarded 

as a rotation in the x , r plane 

from one set of rectangular axes to another 

in a four-dimensional space-time continuum 

(see Chapter VII.). 

fFor the relationships between 
other measurements, 
jee Chapter VIII. 



86 



THE MORAL 

1. Local, "provincial" measurements 
are not universal, 

although they may be used 
to obtain universal realities 
if compared with other systems of 
local measurements taken from 
a different viewpoint. 
By examining certain 

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN 
LOCAL MEASUREMENTS, 

and finding those relationships which 

remain unchanged in going from 

one local system to another, 

one may arrive at 

the INVARIANTS of our universe. 

2. By emphasizing the fact that 
absolute space and time 
are pure mental fictions, 

and that the only PRACTICAL notions of time 

that man can have 

are obtainable only by some method of signals, 

the Einstein Theory shows that 

'Idealism" alone, 

that is, "a priori 11 thinking alone, 

cannot serve for exploring the universe. 

On the other hand, 

since actual measurements 

are local and not universal, 

87 



and that only certain 

THEORETICAL RELATIONSHIPS 

are universal, 

the Einstein Theory shows also that 

practical measurement alone 

is also not sufficient 

for exploring the universe. 

In short, 

a judicious combination 

Of THEORY and PRACTICE, 

EACH GUIDING the other 

a "dialectical materialism" 

is our most effective weapon. 




PART II 
THE GENERAL THEORY 



A GUIDE FOR THE READER. 

I. The first three chapters of Part II give 
the meaning of the term 
''General Relativity/* 
what it undertakes to do, 
and what are its basic ideas. 
These are easy reading and important. 

II. Chapters XIII, XIV, and XV introduce 
the fundamental mathematical ideas 
which will be needed 

also easy reading and important. 

III. Chapters XVI to XXII build up 
the actual 

streamlined mathematical machinery 

not difficult, but require 

the kind of 

care and patience and work 

that go with learning to 

run any NEW machine. 

The amazing POWER of this new 

TENSOR CALCULUS, 

and the EASE with which it is operated, 
are a genuine delight! 

IV. Chapters XXIII to XXVIII show how 
this machine is used to derive the 

NEW LAW OF GRAVITATION. 

This law, 

though at first complicated 

91 



behind its seeming simplicity, 

is then 

REALLY SIMPLIFIED. 

V. Chapters XXIX to XXXIV constitute 
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING! 
easy reading again 
and show 
what the machine has accomplished. 

Then there are 

a SUMMARY 

and 

THE MORAL 



92 



INTRODUCTION, 

In Part I, 

on the SPECIAL Theory, 

it was shown that 

two observers who 

are moving relatively to each other 

with UNIFORM velocity 

can formulate 

the laws of the universe 

"W!TH EQUAL RIGHT AND 
EQUAL SUCCESS, 11 
even though 
their points of view 
are different, 

and their actual measurements 
do not agree. 

The things that appear alike 

to them both 

are the 'TACTS 11 of the universe, 

the INVARIANTS. 

The mathematical relationships 

which both agree on 

are the "LAWS 11 of the universe. 

Since man does not know 

the "true laws of God/ 1 

why should any one human viewpoint 

be singled out 

as more correct than any other? 

And therefore 

it seems most fitting 

to call THOSE relationships 

95 



"THE laws," 

which are VALID from 

DIFFERENT viewpoints, 

taking into consideration 

all experimental data 

known up to the present time. 

Now, it must be emphasized 

that in the Special Theory, 

only that change of viewpoint 

was considered 

which was due to 

the relative UNIFORM velocity 

of the different observers. 

This was accomplished by 

Einstein 

in his first paper* 

published in 1905. 

Subsequently, in 1916*, 

he published a second paper 

in which 

he GENERALIZED the idea 

to include observers 

moving relatively to each other 

with a CHANGING velocity 

(that is, with an ACCELERATION), 

and that is why it is called 

"the GENERAL Theory of Relativity. 11 

It was shown in Part I 

that 

to make possible 

even the SPECIAL case considered there, 

was not an easy task, 

*See "The Principle of Relativity* 1 
by A. Einstein and Others, 
published by Methuen & Co., London. 

96 



for it required 

a fundamental change in Physics 

to remove the 

APPARENT CONTRADICTION 

between certain 

EXPERIMENTAL FACTS! 

Namely, 

the change from the OLD idea 

that TIME is absolute 

(that is, 

that it is the same (or all observers) 

to the NEW idea that 

time is measured 

RELATIVELY to an observer, 

just as the ordinary 

space coordinates, x , y , z, 

are measured relatively to 

a particular set of axes. 

This SINGLE new idea 

was SUFFICIENT 

to accomplish the task 

undertaken in 

the Special Theory. 

We shall now see that 

again 

by the addition of 

ONLY ONE more idea, 

called 

"THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE/ 1 

Einstein made possible 

the GENERAL Theory. 

Perhaps the reader may ask 

why the emphasis on the fact that 

ONLY ONE new idea 

was added? 

Are not ideas good things? 

97 



And is it not desirable 

to have as many of them as possible? 

To which the answer is that 

the adequateness 

of a new scientific theory 

is judged 

(a) By its correctness, of course, 
and 

(b) By its SIMPLICITY. 

No doubt everyone appreciates 

the need for correctness, 

but perhaps 

the lay reader may not realize 

the great importance of 

SIMPLICITY! 

iJBut," he will say, 

"surely the Einstein Theory 

is anything but simple! 

Has it not the reputation 

of being unintelligible 

to all but a very few experts?" 

Of course 

"SIMPLE 11 does not necessarily mean 

"simple to everyone/* * 

but only in the sense that 

*lndeed, it can even be simple to 
everyone WHO 

will take the trouble to learn some 
mathematics. 
Though this mathematics 
was DEVELOPED by experts, 
it can be UNDERSTOOD by 
any earnest student. 
Perhaps even the lay reader 
will appreciate this 
after reading this little book. 

98 



if all known physical (acts 
are taken into consideration, 
the Einstein Theory accounts for 
a large number of these facts 
in the SIMPLEST known way. 

Let us now see 

what is meant by 

"The Principle of Equivalence/* 

and what it accomplishes. 

It is impossible to refrain 

from the temptation 

to brag about it a bit 

in anticipation! 

And to say that 

by making the General Theory possible, 

Einstein derived 

A NEW LAW OF GRAVITATION 

which is even more adequate than 

the Newtonian one, 

since it explains, 

QUITE INCIDENTALLY, 

experimental facts 
which were left unexplained 
by the older theory, 
and which had troubled 
the astronomers 
for a long time. 

And, furthermore, 

the General Theory 

PREDICTED NEW FACTS, 

which have since been verified 

this is of course 

the supreme test of any theory. 

But let us get to work 
to show all this. 

99 



XL THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE. 



Consider the following situation: 

Suppose that a man, Mr. K, 

lives in a spacious box, 

away from the earth 

and from all other bodies, 

so that there is no force of gravity 

there. 

And suppose that 

the box and all its contents 

are moving (in the direction 

indicated in the drawing on p. 100) 

with a changing velocity, 

increasing 32 ft. per second 

every second. 

Now Mr. K, 

who cannot look outside of the box, 

does not know all this; 

but, being an intelligent man, 

he proceeds to study the behavior 

of things around him. 

We watch him from the outside, 
but he cannot see us. 

We notice that 
he has a tray in his hands. 
And of course we know that 
the tray shares the motion of 
everything in the box, 

101 



and therefore remains 

relatively at rest to him 

namely, in his hands. 

But he does not think of it in 

this way/ 

to him, everything is actually 

at rest. 

Suddenly he lets 30 the tray. 
Now we know that the tray will 
continue to move upward with 
CONSTANT velocity/* 
and, since we also know that the box 
is moving upwards with 

an ACCELERATION, 

we expect that very soon the floor 

will catch up with the tray 

and hit it. 

And, of course, we see this 

actually happen. 

Mr. K also sees it happen, 

but explains it differently, 

he says that everything was still 

until he let go the tray, 

and then the tray FELL and 

hit the floor; 

and K attributes this to 

"A force of gravity. 11 

Now K begins to study this "force. 11 

He finds that there is an attraction 

between every two bodies, 

*Any moving object CONTINUES to move 
with CONSTANT speed in a 
STRAIGHT LINE due to inertia, 
unless it is stopped by 
some external force, 
like friction, (or example. 

102 



and its strength is proportional to 

their "gravitational masses/ 1 

and varies inversely as the 

square of the distance between them. 

He also makes other experiments, 
studying the behavior of bodies 
pulled along a smooth table top, 
and finds that different bodies offer 
different degrees of resistance to 
this pull, 

and he concludes that the resistance 
is proportional to the 
"inertial mass" of a body. 

And then he finds that 

ANY object which he releases 

FALLS with the SAME acceleration, 

and therefore decides that 

the gravitational mass and 

the inertial mass of a body 

are proportional to each other. 

In other words, he explains the fact 

that all bodies fall with the 

SAME acceleration, 

by saying that the force of gravity 

is such that 

the greater the resistance to motion 

which a body has, 

the harder gravity pulls it, 

and indeed this increased pull 

is supposed to be 

JUST BIG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME 

the larger resistance, 

and thus produce 

THE SAME ACCELERATION IN ALL BODIES! 

Now, if Mr. K is a very intelligent 

103 



Newtonian physicist, 

he says, 

"How strange that these two distinct 

properties of a body should 

always be exactly proportional 

to each other. 

But experimental (acts show 

this accident to be true, 

and experiments cannot be denied." 

But it continues to worry him. 

On the other hand, 

if K is an Einsteinian relativist, 

he reasons entirely differently: 

"There is nothing absolute about 

my way of looking at phenomena. 

Mr. K 1 , outside, 

(he means us), 

may see this entire room moving 

upward with an acceleration, 

and attribute all these happenings 

to this motion 

rather than to 

a force of gravity 

as I am doing. 

His explanation and mine 

are equally good, 

from our different viewpoints." 

This is what Einstein called 
the Principle of Equivalence. 

Relativist K continues: 

"let me try to see things from 

the viewpoint of 

my good neighbor, K f , 

though I have never met him. 

He would of course see 

104 



the floor of this room come up and 
hit ANY object which I might release, 
and it would therefore seem 
ENTIRELY NATURAL to him 

for all objects released 

from a given height 

at a given time 

to reach the floor together, 

which of course is actually the case. 

Thus, instead of finding out by 

long and careful EXPERIMENTATION 

that 

the gravitational and inertial masses 

are proportional, 

as my Newtonian ancestors did/ 

he would predict A PRIORI 

that this MUST be the case. 

And so, 

although the facts are explainable 

in either way, 

K"s point of view is 

the simpler one, 

and throws light on happenings which 

I could acquire only by 

arduous experimentation, 

if I were not a relativist and hence 

quite accustomed to give 

equal weight to 

my neighbor's viewpoint! 

Of course as we have told the story, 

we know that K f is really right: 

But remember that 

in the actual world 

we do not have this advantage: 

We cannot "know" which of the two 

explanations is "really" correct. 

105 



But, since they are EQUIVALENT, 
we may select the simpler one, 
as Einstein did. 

Thus we already see 

an advantage in 

Einstein's Principle of Equivalence. 

And, 

as we said in Chapter X. 

this is only the beginning, 

(or it led to his 

new Law of Gravitation which 

RETAINED ALL THE MERITS OF 
NEWTON'S LAW, 

and 

has additional NEW merits which 

Newton's Law did not have. 

As we shall see, 



106 



XII. A NON-EUCLIDEAN WORLD. 

Granting, then, 

the Principle of Equivalence, 

according to which Mr. K may replace 

the idea of a "force of gravity 11 by 

a "fictitious force 1 * due to motion/ 

the next question is: 

"How does this help us to derive 

A new Law of Gravitation? 11 

In answer to which 

we ask the reader to recall 

a few simple things which 

he learned in elementary physics in 

high school: 

*The idea of a "fictitious force 11 
due to motion 
is familiar to everyone 
in the following example: 
Any youngster knows that 
if he swings a pail full of water 
in a vertical plane 
WITH SUFFICIENT SPEED, 
the water will not fall out of the pail, 
even when the pail is 
actually upside down! 
And he knows that 
the centrifugal "force" 
is due to the motion only, 
since, 

if he slows down the motion, 
the water WILL fall out 
and give him a good dousing. 

107 



If a force acts on a moving object 

at an angle to this motion, 

it will change the course of the object, 

and we say that 

the body has acquired an 

ACCELERATION, 

even though its speed may have 

remained unchanged! 

This can best be seen with the aid of 

the following diagram: 




If AB represents the original velocity 

(both in magnitude and direction) 

and if the next second 

the object is moving with a velocity 

represented by AC , 

due to the fact that 

some force (like the wind) 

pulled it out of its course, 

then obviously 

108 



BC must be the velocity which 

had to be "added" to AB 

to give the "resultant 11 AC, 

as any aviator, or even 

any high school boy, knows from 

the "Parallelogram of forces. 1 ' 

Thus BC is the difference between 

the two velocities, >ACand AB. 

And, since 

ACCELERATION is defined as 

the change in velocity, each second, 

then BC is the acceleration, 

even if AB and AC happen to be 

equal in length, 

that is, 

even if the speed of the object 

has remained unchanged;* 

the very fact that it has merely 

changed in DIRECTION 

shows that there is an ACCELERATION! 

Thus, 

if an object moves in a circle/ 

with uniform speed, 

it is moving with 

an acceleration since 

it is always changing its direction. 

Now imagine a physicist who 

lives on a disc which 

is revolving with constant speed! 

Being a physicist, 

he is naturally curious about the world, 

and wishes to study it, 

even as you and I. 

And, even though we tell him that 

*This distinction between "speed 11 and "velocity" 
is discussed on page 1 28. 

109 



he is moving with an acceleration 
he, being a democrat and a relativist, 
insists that he can formulate 
the laws of the universe 

"WITH EQUAL RIGHT AND 
EQUAL SUCCESS : 

and therefore claims that 

he is not moving at all 

but is merely in an environment in which 

a "force of gravity 11 is acting 

(Have you ever been on a revolving disc 

and actually felt this "force 11 ?!). 

Let us now watch him 

tackle a problem: 

We see him become interested in circles: 

He wants to know whether 

the circumferences of two circles 

are in the same ratio as their radii. 

He draws two circles, 

a large one and a small one 

(concentric with 

the axis of revolution of the disc) 

and proceeds to measure 

their radii and circumferences. 

When he measures the larger circumference, 

we know, 

from a study of 

the Special Theory of Relativity* 

that he will get a different value 

from the one WE should get 

(not being on the revolving disc); 

but this is not the case with 

his measurements of the radii, 

since the shrinkage in length, 

described in the Special Theory, 

"See Part I of this book. 

110 



takes place only 

IN THE DIRECTION OF MOTION, 

and not in a direction which is 

PERPENDICULAR to the direction of motion 

(as a radius is). 

Furthermore/ when he measures 

the circumference of the small circle, 

his value is not very different from ours 

since the speed of rotation is small 

around a small circle, 

and the shrinkage is therefore 

negligible. 

And so, finally, it turns out that 

he finds that the circumferences 

are NOT in the same ratio as the radii! 

Do we tell him that he is wrong? 

that this is not according to Euclid? 

and that he is a fool for trying 

to study Physics on a revolving disc? 

Not at all! 

On the contrary, 

being modern relativists, we say 

"That is quite all right, neighbor, 

you are probably no worse than we are, 

you don't have to use Euclidean geometry if 

it does not work on a revolving disc, 

for now there are 

non-Euclidean geometries which are 

exactly what you need 

Just as we would not expect 

Plane Trigonometry to work on 

a large portion of the earth's surface 

for which we need 

Spherical Trigonometry, 

in which 

the angle-sum of a triangle 

isNOTlSO , 

111 



as we might naively demand after 
a high school course in 
Euclidean plane geometry, 

In short/ 

instead of considering the disc-world 

as an accelerated system, 

we can, 

by the Principle of Equivalence, 

regard it as a system in which 

a "force of gravity 11 is acting, 

and, from the above considerations, 

we see that 

in a space having such a 

gravitational field 

Non-Euclidean geometry, 

rather than Euclidean, 

is applicable. 

We shall now illustrate 

how the geometry of 

a surface or a space may be studied. 

This will lead to 

the mathematical consideration of 

Einstein's Law of Gravitation 

and its consequences. 



XIII. THE STUDY OF SPACES. 

Let us consider first 

the familiar Euclidean plane. 

Everyone knows that 

for a right triangle on such a plane 

the Pythagorean theorem holds: 

Namely, 

113 




that s 2 

Conversely, 

it is true that 

IF the distance between two points 

on a surface 

is given by 

(1) s 2 = * 2 + y> 

THEN 

the surface MUST BE 

A EUCLIDEAN PLANE, 

Furthermore, 

it is obvious that 

the distance from to A 

ALONG THE CURVE: 
114 




is no longer 

the hypotenuse of a right triangle, 

and of course 

we CANNOT write here s 2 = x 2 + y 2 ! 

If, however, 

we take two points, A and 8, 

sufficiently near together, 

the curve AB is so nearly 

a straight line, 

that we may actually regard 

ABC as a little right triangle 

in which the Pythagorean theorem 

does hold. 

115 



Only that here 

we shall represent its three sides 

by c/s , c/x and c/y , 

as is done in 

the differential calculus, 

to show that 

the sides are small. 

So that here we have 

(2) c/s 2 = </x 2 + c/y 2 

Which still has the form of (1) 

and is characteristic of 

the Euclidean plane. 

It will be found convenient 

to replace x and y 

by xi and xi , respectively, 

so that (2) may be written 

(3) c/s 2 - c/x L 2 + c/xA 

Now what is the corresponding situation 

on a non-Euclidean surface, 

such as, 

the surface of a sphere, for example? 

Let us take 

two points on this surface, A and 8 , 
designating the position of each 
by its latitude and longitude: 



116 



**"^^ \ 

TV 



Let Df be the meridian 

from which 

longitude is measured 

the Greenwich meridian. 

And let DK be a part of the equator, 

and the north pole. 

Then the longitude and latitude of A 

are, respectively, 

the number of degrees in 

the arcs ^F and AG , 

(or in the 

corresponding central angles, a and 0). 

Similarly, 

117 



the longitude and latitude of 8 
are, respectively, 
the number of degrees in 
the arcs CF and BK. 

The problem again is 

to find the distance 

between A and B. 

If the triangle /ABC is 

sufficiently small, 

we may consider it to lie 

en a Euclidean plane which 

practically coincides with 

the surface of the sphere in 

this little region, 

and the sides of the triangle ABC 

to be straight lines 

(as on page 1 1 5). 

Then, 

since the angle at C 

is a right angle, 

we have 

(4) AB* = A? + BC*- 

And now let us see 

what this expression becomes 

if we change 

the Cartesian coordinates in (4) 

(in the tangent Euclidean plane) 

to the coordinates known as 

longitude and latitude 

on the surface of the sphere. 

Obviously AB 

has a perfectly definite length 

irrespective of 

118 



c 




which coordinate system we use; 

but>4C and BC, 

the Cartesian coordinates in 

the tangent Euclidean plane 

may be transformed into 

longitude and latitude on 

the surface of the sphere, thus: 

let r be 

the radius of the latitude circle FAC, 

and R the radius of the sphere. 

Then 



Similarly 

BC =/?$. 

Therefore, substituting in (4), 
we have 



(5) c/s 2 = tJc? + 



And, replacing a by xi , and j8 by 
this may be written 

(6) c/s 2 = i>c/x? + tfdxt . 

A comparison of (6) and (3) 
will show that 




*any high school student knows 
that if x represents the length of 
an arc, and is the number of 
radians in it, then 



And therefore 

x = 

120 



on the sphere, 

the expression (or c/s 2 

is not quite so simple 

as it was on the Euclidean plane. 

The question naturally arises, 

does this distinction between 

a Euclidean and a non-Euclidean surface 

always hold, 

and is this a way 

to distinguish between them? 

That is, 

if we know 

the algebraic expression which represents 

the distance between two points 

which actually holds 

on a given surface, 

can we then immediately decide 

whether the surface 

is Euclidean or not? 

Or does it perhaps depend upon 

the coordinate system used? 

To answer this, 

let us 30 back to the Euclidean plane, 

and use oblique coordinates 

instead of the more familiar 

rectangular ones 

thus: 



121 




The coordinates of the point A 

are now represented by 

xand y 

which are measured 

parallel to the X and Y axes, 

and are now 

NOT at right angles to each other. 

Can we now find 

the distance between and A 

using these oblique coordinates? 

Of course we can, 

for, 

by the well-known 

Law of Cosines in Trigonometry, 

we can represent 

the length of a side of a triangle 

122 



lying opposite an obtuse angle, 
by: 

s 2 = x 2 + y 2 2xy cos a. 

Or, for a very small triangle, 

</$ 2 = c/x 2 + c/y 2 -2c/x</ycosa. 

And, if we again 
replace x and y 
by xi and X2 , respectively, 
this becomes 

(7) c/s 2 - c/x 2 + Jxl - 2 c/xrc/X2-cosa. 

Here we see that 

even on a Euclidean plane, 

the expression for c/s 2 

is not as simple as it was before. 

And, if we had used 
polar coordinates 
on a Euclidean plane, 
we would have obtained 



or 

(8) Js 2 = c/x 2 + x? 

* (See page 1 24) 



123 



The reader should verify this, 

remembering that 

the polar coordinates of point P 




are 



(1) its distance, xi , from a fixed point, O , 

(2) the angle, x 2 , which OP makes with a fixed line OX. 
Then (8) is obvious from 

the following figure: 




o 



124 



Hence we see that 

the form of the expression for c/r 

depends upon BOTH 

(a) the KIND pF SURFACE 
we are dealing with, 

and 

(b) the particular 

COORDINATE SYSTEM. 

We shall soon see that 

whereas 

a mere superficial inspection 

of the expression for </s 2 

is not sufficient 

to determine the kind of surface 

we are dealing with, 

a DEEPER examination 

of this expression 

DOES help us to know this. 

For this deeper examination 

we must know 

how, 

from the expression for c/s 2 , 

the sVcalled "CURVATURE TENSOR 11 

of the surface. 

And this brings us to 
the study of tensors: 

What are tensors? 
Of what use are they? 
and HOW are they used? 

Let us see. 

125 



XIV. WHAT IS A TENSOR? 

The reader is no doubt familiar 

with the words "scalar 1 * and "vector. 11 

A scalar is a quantity which 

has magnitude only, 

whereas 

a vector has 

both magnitude and direction. 

Thus, 

if we say that 

the temperature at a certain place 

is 70 Fahrenheit, 

there is obviously NO DIRECTION 

to this temperature, 

and hence 

TEMPERATURE is a SCALAR. 

But 

if we say that 

an airplane has gone 

one hundred miles east, 

obviously its displacement 

from its original position 

is a VECTOR, 

whose MAGNITUDE is 100 miles, 

and whose DIRECTION is EAST. 

Similarly, 

a person's AGE is a SCALAR, 

whereas 



127 



the VELOCITY with which an object moves 

is a VECTOR,* 

and so on; 

the reader can easily 

find further examples 

of both scalars and vectors. 

We shall now discuss 

some quantities 

which come up in our experience 

and which are 

neither scalars nor vectors, 

but which are called 

TENSORS. 

And, 

when we have illustrated and defined these, 

we shall find that 

a SCALAR is a TENSOR whose RANK is ZERO, 

and 

a VECTOR is a TENSOR whose RANK is ONE, 

and we shall see what is meant by 

a TENSOR of RANK TWO, or THREE, etc. 

Thus "TENSOR" is a more inclusive term, 

*A distinction is often made between 
"speed" and "velocity "- 
the former is a SCALAR, the latter a VECTOR. 
Thus when we are interested ONLY in 
HOW FAST a thing is moving, 
and do not care about its 
DIRECTION of motion, 
we must then speak of its SPEED, 
but if we are interested ALSO in its 

DIRECTION, 

we must speak of its VELOCITY. 

Thus the SPEED of an automobile 

would be designated by 

"Thirty miles an hour," 

but its VELOCITY would be 

"Thirty miles an hour EAST." 

128 



of which "SCALAR 11 and "VECTOR 11 are 
SPECIAL CASES. 

Before we discuss 

the physical meaning of 

a tensor of rank two, 

let us consider 

the following facts about vectors. 

Suppose that we have 

any vector, AB , in a plane, 

and suppose that 

we draw a pair of rectangular axes, 

X and y, 

thus: 

T 



B 



X' 




Drop a perpendicular BC 

from 8 to the X-axis. 

Then we may say that 

AC is the X-component oF AB , 

and CB is the /-component of 

for, 

as we know from 

the elementary law of 

"The parallelogram of forces/* 

if a force AC acts on a particle 

and CB also acts on it, 

the resultant effect is the same 

as that of a force AB alone. 

And that is why 

>AC and CB are called 

the "components" of AB. 

Of course if we had used 

the dotted lines as axes instead, 

the components of AB 

would now be AD and DB. 

In other words, 

the vector AB may be broken up 

into components 

in various ways, 

depending upon our choice of axes. 

Similarly, 

if we use THREE axes in SPACE 

rather than two in a plane, 

we can break up a vector 

into THREE components 

as shown 

in the diagram 

on page 1 31 . 



130 




D 



By dropping the perpendicular BD 

from 8 to the XY-plane, 

and then drawing 

the perpendiculars DC and DE 

to the X and Y axes, respectively, 

we have the three components of AB L 

namely, 



and, as before, 

the components depend upon 

the particular choice of axes. 

Let us now illustrate 
the physical meaning 
of a tensor of rank two. 

Suppose we have a rod 
at every point of which 
there is a certain strain 
due to some force acting on it, 
As a rule the strain 

131 



is not the same at all points, 
and, even at any given point, 
the strain is not the same in 



all directions.* 



Now, if the STRESS at the point A 

(that is, the FORCE causing the strain at A) 

is represented 

both in magnitude and direction 

by/B 




*When an object finally breaks 
under a sufficiently great strain, 
it does not fly into bits 
as it would do if 
the strain were the same 
at all points and in all directions, 
but breaks along certain lines 
where, for one reason or another, 
the strain is greatest. 

132 



and if we are interested to know 

the effect of this force upon 

the surface CDE F (through A} f 

we are obviously dealing 

with a situation which depends 

not on a SINGLE vector, 

but on TWO vectors: 

Namely, 

one vector, AB , 

which represents the force in question; 

and another vector 

(call it /AG), 

whose direction will indicate 

the ORIENTATION of the surface CDEF, 

and whose magnitude will represent 

the AREA of CDEF. 

In other words, 

the effect of a force upon a surface 

depends NOT ONLY on the force itself 

but ALSO on the 

size and orientation of the surface. 

Now, how can we indicate 

the orientation of a surface 

by a line? 

If we draw a line through A 

in the plane CDEF , 

obviously we can draw this line 

in many different directions, 

and there is no way 

of choosing one of these 

to represent the orientation of this surface. 

BUT, 

if we take a line through A 

PERPENDICULAR to the plane CDEF, 

such a line is UNIQUE 

133 



and CAN therefore be used 

to specify the orientation 

of the surface CDEF. 

Hence, if we draw a vector, 

in a direction perpendicular to CDEF 

and of such a length that 

it represents the magnitude of 

the area of CDEF, 

then obviously 

this vector AG 

indicates clearly 

both the SIZE and the ORIENTATION 

of the surface CDEF. 

Thus. 

the STRESS at A 

upon the surface CDEF 
depends upon the TWO vectors, 
AB and AG , 
and is called 

a TENSOR of RANK TWO. 

Let us now find a convenient way 
of representing this tensor. 
And, in order to do so, 
let us consider the stress, F, 
upon a small surface, c/S , 
represented in the following figure 



Now if OG, perpendicular to ABC 
is the vector which represents 
the size and orientation of ABC , 
then, 



134 



z 



c 




it is quite easy to see (page 1 36) 

that the X-component of OG 

represents in magnitude and direction 

the projection 08C of ABC upon the XZ-plane. 

And similarly, 

the 7 and Z components of OG 

represent the projections 

0/C and 0/B , respectively. 



135 



To show that OK represents OBC 
both in magnitude and direction: 




T 

That it does so in direction 

is obvious, 

since OK is perpendicular to OBC (see p. 1 34). 

As regards the magnitude 

we must now show that 

OK _ OBC 

OG ABC' 

(a) Now OBC = ABC x cos of the dihedral angle 

between ABC and OBC 

(since the area of the projection 

of a given surface 

is equal to 

ihe area of the given surface multiplied by 

136 



the cosine of the dihedral angle 
between the two planes). 
But this dihedral angle equals anale GO/C 
since 06 and OK are respectively 
perpendicular to ABC and OBC , 
and cos ZGOKisOK/OG. 
Substitution of this in (a) 
gives the required 

OBC _ OK 

ABC OG- 

Now, if the force F , 

which is itself a vector, 

acts on ABC , 

we can examine its total effect 

by considering separately 

the effects of its three components 

fx i fy i and f z 

upon EACH of the three projections 
OBC,OAC*ndOAB. 

Let us designate these projections 
by dS x / dS y end dS z , respectively. 

Now, 
since f x 

(which is the X-component of F) 
acts upon EACH one of the three 
above-mentioned projections, 
let us designate the pressure 
due to this component alone 
upon the three projections 
by 

Pxx / Pxy , Pxz / 

respectively. 

We must emphasize 

the significance of this notation: 

In the first place, 

137 



the reader must distinguish between 
the "pressure" on a surface 
and the "force" acting on the surface. 
The M p ressurel1 k 

the FORCE PER UNIT AREA. 

So that 

the TOTAL FORCE is obtained by 

MULTIPLYING 

the PRESSURE by the AREA of the surface. 

Thus the product 

PXX ' dSx 

gives the force acting upon 
the projection dS, 
due to the action of f, ALONE. 
Note the DOUBLE subscripts in 

PXX i Pxy i PXZ ' 

The first one obviously refers to the fact 

that 

these three pressures all emanate 

from the component f., alone; 

whereas, 

the second subscript designates 

the particular projection upon which 

the pressure acts. 

Thus p/.v means 

the pressure due to f r 

upon the projection dS y , 

Etc. 

It follows therefore that 

fx = pxx'dSx + Pxy'dSy + pxz'd 

And, similarly, 

>y ~ Pyx'dSx -f Pyy'dSy + Pyz'J 

and 

fx = PZX ' dSx ~\~ fzy ' dSy + p z z dS 

138 



Hence the TOTAL STRESS, F, 
on the surface c/S, 

F=(x+(y + ?, 

or 

i = PXX ' cfix ~T Pxy * cr jj/ ~r PXZ ' dS z 

+ Pyx ' uSx H~ Pyy ' uSy + p yz ' C/S 2 
+ PZX ' dSx + PZU ' dSy ~\- p Z2 ' C/Sz . 

Thus we see that 

stress is not just a vector, 

with three components in 

three-dimensional space (see p. 1 30) 

but has NINE components 

in THREE-dimensional space. 

Such a quantity is called 

A TENSOR OF RANK TWO. 

For the present 

let this illustration of a tensor suffice: 

Later we shall give a precise definition. 

It is obvious that 

if we were dealing with a plane 

instead of with 

three-dimensional space, 

a tensor of rank two would then have 

only FOUR components instead of nine, 

since each of the two vectors involved 

has only two components in a plane, 

and therefore, 

there would now be only 

2X2 components for the tensor 

instead of 3 X 3 as above. 

And, in general, 
if we are dealing with 
n-dimensional space, 

139 



a tensor of rank two 

has n components 

which are therefore conveniently written 

in a SQUARE array 

as was done on page 1 39. 

Whereas, 

in n-dimensional space/ 

a VECTOR has only n components: 

Thus, 

a VECTOR in a PLANE 

has TWO components/ 

in THREE-dimensional space it has 

THREE components/ 

and so on. 

Hence, 

the components of a VECTOR 

are therefore written 

in a SINGLE ROW; 

instead of in a SQUARE ARRAY 

as in the case of a TENSOR of RANK TWO. 

Similarly, 

in n-dimensional space 

a TENSOR of rank THREE has n 3 components, 

and so on. 

To sum up: 

In n-dimensional space, 

a VECTOR has n components, 

a TENSOR of rank TWO has n 2 components, 

a TENSOR of rank THREE has n 3 components, 

and so on. 

The importance of tensors 
in Relativity 
will become clear 
as we 90 on. 

140 



XV. THE EFFECT ON TENSORS OF A 

CHANGE IN THE COORDINATE 

SYSTEM. 

In Part I of this book (page 61) 
we had occasion to mention 
the fact that 
the coordinates of the point A 




141 



in the unprimed coordinate system 
can be expressed in terms of 
its coordinates in the 
primed coordinate system 
by the relationships 



/ O v / x = x co$0 y f 

w (y = x sin0 + / cos0 

as is known to any young student of 
elementary analytical geometry. 

Let us now see 

what effect this change in 

the coordinate system 

has 

upon a vector and its components. 

Call the vector cfs, 

and let o'x and c/y represent 

its components in the UNPRIMED SYSTEM, 

and dx and c/y' 

its components in the PRIMED SYSTEM 

as shown on page 143. 



142 




Obviously c/s itself 

is not affected by the change 

of coordinate system, 

but the COMPONENTS of </s 

in the two systems 

are DIFFERENT, 

as we have already pointed out 

on page 1 30. 

Now if the coordinates of point A 
are x and y in one system 

143 



and x' and / in the other, 

the relationship between 

these four quantities 

is given by equations (9) on p. 142. 

And now, from these equations, 

we can, by differentiation*, 

find the relationships between 

c/x and c/y 

and 

c/x' and c/y 7 . 

It will be noticed, 

in equations (9), 

that 

x depends upon BOTH x and y', 

so that any changes in x' and y' 

will BOTH affect x. 

Hence the TOTAL change in x, 

namely c/x , 

will depend upon TWO causes: 

(a) Partially upon the change in x', 
namely c/x' , 

and 

(b) Partially upon the change in y', 
namely c/y 7 . 

Before writing out these changes, 
it will be found more convenient 
to solve (9) for x 7 and y 7 
in terms of x and y.| 

*See any book on 

Differential Calculus. 
fAssuming of course that the 

determinant of the coefficients in (9) 

is not zero. 

(See the chapter on "Determinants" in 

"Higher Algebra" by M. Bocher.) 

144 



In other words, 

to express the 

NEW, primed coordinates, x' and /, 

in terms of the 

OLD, original ones, x and y , 

rather than the other way around. 

This will of course give us 



x' == ax + 6y 



(10) < , , , 

N ' \ y = ex + dy 

where a, fc, c, J are functions of 0. 

It will be even better 
to write (1 0) in the form: 



(11) 

x ' x 2 = 621X1 

using xi and XL instead of x and y , 

(and of course x[ and x' 2 instead of 

x' and /); 

and putting different subscripts 

on the single letter a , 

instead of using 

four different letters: a , b , c , d 

The advantage of this notation is 

not only that we can 

easily GENERALIZE to n dimensions 

from the above 

two-dimensional statements, 

but, 

as we shall see later, 

this notation lends itself to 

a beautifully CONDENSED way of 

writing equations, 

which renders them 

very EASY to work with. 

145 



Let us now proceed with 
the differentiation of (11): 
we get 

(1 2) I k' = ail( ' Xl "^ ai2C ^ X2 

* ' \ C/X2 = 521C/X1 + a 2 2C/X? 

The MEANING of the a's in (12) 

should be clearly understood: 

Thus an is 

the change in x'\ due to 

A UNIT CHANGE in xi, 

so that 

when it is multiplied by 

the total change in xi , namely c/xi , 

we get 

THE CHANGE IN *( DUE TO 

THE CHANGE IN * ALONE. 

And similarly in a^cfa, 

612 represents 

the change in xi PER UNIT CHANGE in x 2 , 

and therefore 

the product of a\? and 

the total change in x / namely dx , 

gives 

THE CHANGE IN x{ DUE TO 

THE CHANGE IN x 2 ALONE. 

Thus 

the TOTAL CHANGE in xi 

is given by 



just as 

the total cost of 

a number of apples and oianges 

would be found 

by multiplying the cost of 

ONE APPLE 

by the total number of apples, 

146 



and ADDING this result 
to a similar one 
for the oranges. 

And similarly for Jx 2 in (1 2). 

We may therefore 
replace an by dx(/dx\ 
a symbol which represents 
the partial change in xj 
per unit change in xi*, 
and is called 

the "partial derivative of xi 
with respect to xi ." 

Similarly, 

dx{ 9x2 _ 9x5 

3l2 ~ ' / cl21 ~ T~~ / ^22 ^ " 
9X2 OXi 0X2 

And we may therefore rewrite (1 2) 
in the form 

dx{ j dx{ 

dx\ H 

f\ *^i i f\ 

OXi 0X2 

(13) 



9X2 , , <?X2 
2 = T-'CfXi + T~ 

0x2 



</X2 = 



But perhaps the reader 

is getting a little tired of all this, 

and is wondering 

what it has to do 

with Relativity. 

*Note that a PARTIAL change 
is always denoted by the letter "d" 

i A A MJM 

in contrast to d 

which designates a TOTAL change 

147 



c 




To which we may give him 

a partial answer now 

and hold out hope 

of further information 

in the remaining chapters. 

What we can already say is that 

since General Relativity is concerned with 

finding the laws of the physical world 

which hold good for ALL observers/ 

and since various observers 

differ from each other, 

as physicists, 

only in that they 

use different coordinate systems, 

we see then 

that Relativity is concerned 

with finding out those things 

which remain INVARIANT 

under transformations of 

coordinate systems. 

Now, as we saw on page 143, 

a vector is such an INVARIANT/ 

and, similarly, 

tensors in general 

are such INVARIANTS, 

so that the business of the physicist 

really becomes 

to find out 

which physical quantities 

are tensors, 

and are therefore 

the "facts of the universe/ 1 

since they hold good 

for all observers. 

*See p. 96. 

149 



Besides, 

as we promised on page 125, 

we must explain the meaning of 

"curvature tensor/ 1 

since it is this tensor 

which CHARACTERIZES a space. 

And then 

with the aid of the curvature tensor of 

our four-dimensional world of events,* 

we shall find out 

how things move in this world 

what paths the planets take, 

and in what path 

a ray of light travels 

as it passes near the sun, 

and so on. 

And of course 

these are all things which 

can be 

VERIFIED BY EXPERIMENT. 



XVI. A VERY HELPFUL SIMPLIFICATION 

Before we go any further 

let us write equations (13) on page 147 

more briefly 

thus: 

(,4) -** 

*FOUR-dimensional, since 
each event is characterized by 
its THREE space-coordinates and 
the TIME of its occurrence 
(see Part I. of this book, page 58) 

150 



A careful study of (14) will show 

(a) That (14) really contains TWO equations 

(although it looks like only one), 

since, as we give M 

its possible values, 1 and 2 , 

we have 

c/x[ and c/Xj on the left, 

just as we did in (13); 

(b) The symbol 2, means that 
when the various values of <J , 
namely 1 and 2 , 

are substituted for cr 

(keeping the \i constant in any one equation) 

the resulting two terms 

must be ADDED together. 

Thus, for /i = 1 and <r = 1 , 2 , 

(1 4) becomes 

it dx( , . dxi j 
dxi = -dxi + -dx2, 

dxi 0x2 

just like the FIRST equation in (13), 

and, similarly, 

by taking ju = 2 , 

and again "summing on the <r's ," 

since that is what 2, tells us to do, 

we get 

If 3X2 I I 5X 2 J 

dx 2 = T-'cfxi + - -ax2 t 

OXi OX 2 

which is the SECOND equation in (13). 

Thus we see that 

(14) includes all of (13). 

A still further abbreviation 
is introduced by omitting 
the symbol 2, 

151 



WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT 

WHENEVER A SUBSCRIPT OCCURS TWICE 

IN A SINGLE TERM 

(as, for example, <r 

in the right-hand member of (14) ), 

it will be understood that 

a SUMMATION is to be made 

ON THAT SUBSCRIPT. 

Hence we may write (14) as follows: 

(15) <Jx' = dx '*-<lx 

U ; d *" dx. *' 

in which we shall know 
that the presence of the TWO </s 
in the term on the right, 
means that 2 a is understood. 

And now, finally, 

since c/xi and cfe 

are the components of c/s in the 

UNPRIMED system 

let us represent them more briefly by 

A ] and A 2 

respectively. 

The reader must NOT confuse 

these SUPERSCRIPTS 

with EXPONENTS - 

thus >4 2 is not the "square of" A , 

but the superscript serves merely 

the same purpose as a 

SUBSCRIPT, 

namely, 

to distinguish the components 

from each other. 

Just why we use 

SUPERSCRIPTS instead of subscripts 

will appear later (p. 1 72). 

152 



v 



c 




And the components of c/s 

in the PRIMED coordinate system 

will now be written 

A' 1 and A'\ 
Thus (1 5) becomes 



And so, 

if we have a certain vector A" , 

that is, 

a vector whose components are 

A 1 and A 2 

in a certain coordinate system, 

and if we change to 

a new coordinate system 

in accordance with 

the transformation represented by (11) on page 145 , 

then 

(16) tells us what will be 

the components of this same vector 

in the new (PRIMED) coordinate system. 

Indeed, (1 5) or (16) represents 

the change in the components 

of a vector 

NOT ONLY for the change given in (11), 

but for ANY transformation 

of coordinates:* 

Thus 

suppose x, are the coordinates of 

a point in one coordinate system, 

*Except only that 

the values of (x a ) and (x/) must be in 
one-to-one correspondence. 

154 



and suppose that 

xj = ft (xi , x 2/ ....) = ft 

x! 2 =f>(x a ) 
etc. 

Or, representing this entire 
set of equations by 

Xp Ifj. \Xa)f 

where the f s represent 
any (unctions whatever, 
then, obviously 



' - ^ J J- afl J J- 

HI ~ OXi T" ^ 'CTX2 ~r . . . . 
OXi 0X2 



or, since ft = x{ , 



If { = r-~ C/Xi + ^ ' C/X2 + - . . . 
OXi 0X2 



etc. 
Hence 



gives the manner of transformation 
of the vector dx a to 
ANY other coordinate system 
(see the only limitation 
mentioned in the footnote on 
page 1 54). 

And in fact 

ANY set of quantities which 

transforms according to (16) is 

DEFINED TO BE A VECTOR, 

or rather, 

A CONTRAVARIANT VECTOR - 

the meaning of "CONTRAVARIANT" 

155 



will appear later (p. 1 72). 

The reader must not forget that 

whereas the separate components in 

the two coordinate systems are 

different, 

the vector itself is 

an INVARIANT under the 

transformation of coordinates 

(see page 143). 

It should be noted further that 

(16) serves not only to represent 

a two-dimensional vector, 

but may represent 

a three- or four- or 

n-dimensional vector, 

since all that is necessary is 

to indicate the number of values that 

M and (r may take. 

Thus, if JLI = 1 , 2 and <r = 1 , 2 , 

we have a two-dimensional vector/ 

but if M - 1 , 2 , 3 , and a = 1 , 2 , 3 , 

(16) represents a 3-dimensional vector, 

and so on. 

For the case M ^ 1 / 2 , 3 and (7 = 1,2 

(16) obviously represents 

THREE EQUATIONS in which 

the right-hand members 
each have THREE terms: 



(JX[ ux-2 0x3 

3*2 /! i dXo I* , fa' 

-A l + r } -A-+ - 

axi 0x3 5x 3 



156 



Similarly we may now give 

the mathematical definition of 

a tensor of rank two,* 

or of any other rank. 

Thus 

a contravariant tensor of rank two 

is defined as follows: 



(17) 



Here, since 7 and 5 occur TWICE 

in the term on the right, 

it is understood that 

we must SUM for these indices 

over whatever range of values they have. 

Thus if we are speaking of 

THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE, 

we have 7 = 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 = 1 , 2 , 3. 

ALSO a = 1 , 2 , 3 , and = 1 , 2 , 3; 

But 

NO SUMMATION is to be performed 

on the a and j8 

since neither of them occurs 

TWICE in a single term/ 

so that 

any particular values of cv and p 

must be retained throughout ANY ONE equation. 

For example, 

for the case a = 1 , /3 = 2 , 

It will be remembered (see page 128) 
that 

a VECTOR is a TENSOR of RANK ONE. 
157 



(1 7) gives the equation: 

,, _ <9x[ dxs All , dx[ dxj , 12 , dx! 3*2 

/\ ~ V~~ ' r\ ~ ' ^ "I n " ' a ' ^ ' Jl ' 3 

9xi 9xi 9xi 0x2 9xi 0x3 



.. . . __ . 

6x2 9xi 9x2 9x2 9x2 9x3 

+ ^.^./31 + dx l. dx *. A V , ??!. dx ?. 
9X3 9xi 9X3 9X2 9X3 9X3 

It will be observed that 7 and <5 

have each taken on 

their THREE possible values: 1,2,3, 

which resulted in 

NINE terms on the right/ 

whereas 

a = 1 and ft = 2 

have been retained throughout. 

And now since a and /3 

may each have the three values, 1,2,3, 

there will be 

NINE such EQUATIONS in all. 

Thus (1 7) represents 

nine equations each containing 

nine terms on the right, 

if we are considering 

three-dimensional space. 

Obviously for two-dimensional space, 

(17) will represent 

only four equations each containing 

only four terms on the right. 

Whereas, 

in four dimensions, 

as we must have in 

Relativity* 

*See the footnote on p. 1 50. 
158 



(17) will represent 

sixteen equations each containing 
sixteen terms on the right. 

And ; in general, 

in n-dimensional space, 

a tensor of RANK TWO, 

defined by (17), 

consists of 

n equations, each containing 

n terms in the right-hand member. 

Similarly, 

a contravariant tensor of RANK THREE 

is defined by 

(18) A'-to-l^-^-A 

vXp ox? dx ff 

and so on. 

As before, 

the number of equations represented by (18) 

and the number of terms on the right in each, 

depend upon 

the dimensionality of the space in question. 

The reader can already appreciate somewhat 

the remarkable brevity 

of this notation, 

But when he will see in the next chapter 

how easily such sets of equations 

are MANIPULATED, 

he will be really delighted, 

we are sure of that. 



159 



XVII. OPERATIONS WITH TENSORS. 

For example, 

take the vector (or tensor of rank one) A a f 

having the two components A 1 and A 2 

in a plane, 

with reference to a given set of axes. 

And let 6 a be another such vector. 

Then, by adding the corresponding components 

of A a and B a , 

we obtain a quantity 

also having two components, 

namely, 

A 1 + B l and A 2 + B 2 

which may be represented by 

and C 2 , 
respectively. 

Let us now prove 

that this quantity 

is also a vector: 

Since A* is a vector, 

its law of transformation is: 



(19) /V x = M"(see 
Similarly, for B" : 

(20) B' X = ^--B\ 

ox, 

Taking corresponding components, 
160 



AH lAli *. 
f\ /I i ^ 

OXi 0X2 



B/l ^ Xl Dl 1 ^ Xl D2 
= TT ..... D ~r - -D . 

axi 0x2 



we get, in full: 

and 

The sum of these gives: 

Similarly, 

dxi 6x2 

Both these results are included in: 

Or 

(21) c^^-e. 

dx a 

Thus we see that 

the result is 

a VECTOR (see p. 155). 

Similarly for tensors of 
higher ranks. 

Furthermore, 

note that (21) may be obtained 

QUITE MECHANICALLY 

by adding (19) and (20) 

AS IF each of these were 

A SINGLE equation 

containing only 

A SINGLE term on the right, 

161 



c 




instead of 

A SET OF EQUATIONS 

EACH CONTAINING 

SEVERAL TERMS ON THE RIGHT. 

Thus the notation 

AUTOMATICALLY takes care that 
the corresponding components 
shall be properly added. 

This is even more impressive 

in the case of multiplication. 

Thus, 

to multiply 

(22) A' x = M' 
by ^ 

(23) ""^^ (A, /.,,/* = 1,2) 
we write the result immediately: 

(24) 0-g.g.C* (X //t/ ,/3-1,2X 

To convince the reader 

that it is quite safe 

to write the result so simply, 

let us examine (24) carefully 

and see whether it really represents 

correctly 

the result of multiplying (22) by (23). 

By "multiplying (22) by (23)" 

we mean that 

EACH equation of (22) is to be 

multiplied by 

EACH equation of (23) 

163 



in the way in which this would be done 

in ordinary algebra. 

Thus, 

we must first multiply 



b y 

f j \r fj y 



We 8 et, 
(25) 



9xi 9xi 
9x2 9xi 



9xi 9xi 

, - 

ox* 0x2 

Similarly we shall set 
three more such equations/ 
whose left-hand members are, 
respectively, 

A'T, A'-B'\ A"- B' 2 , 

and whose right-hand members 
resemble that of (25). 

Now, we may obtain (25) from (24) 
by taking X = 1 , /* = 1 , 
retaining these values throughout, 
since no summation is indicated on X and 
[that is, neither X nor /x is repeated 
in any one term of (24)]. 

164 



But since a and ft 

each OCCUR TWICE 

in the term on the right, 

they must be allowed to take on 

all possible values, namely, 1 and 2 , 

and SUMMED, 

thus obtaining (25), 

except that we replace A'B** 

by the simpler symbol C a ^ *. 

Similarly, 

by taking A = 1 , /* = 2 in (24), 

and summing on a and /? as before, 

we obtain another of the equations 

mentioned on page 164. 

And X = 2 , /* = 1 , 
gives the third of these equations/ 
and finally A = 2 , M - 2 
gives the fourth and last. 

Thus (24) actually does represent 

COMPLETELY 

the product of (22) and (23)! 

Of course, in three-dimensional space, 
(22) and (23) would each represent 
THREE equations, instead of two, 
each containing 

THREE terms on the right, instead of two; 
and the product of (22) and (23) 



*Note that either A" B or C<* 
allows for FOUR components: 
Namely, AW or C 11 , 
AW or C", 
AW or C 21 , 
and AW or C 22 . 
And hence we may use 
G* instead of A* V. 

165 



would then consist of 

NINE equations, instead of four, 

each containing 

NINE terms on the right, instead of four. 

But this result 

is still represented by (24)! 

And, of course, in four dimensions 

(24) would represent 

SIXTEEN equations, and : 



I so on. 



Thus the tensor notation enables us 

to multiply 

WHOLE SETS OF EQUATIONS 

containing MANY TERMS IN EACH, 

as EASILY as we multiply 

simple monomials in elementary algebra! 

Furthermore, 

we see from (24) 

that 

the PRODUCT of two tensors 

is also a TENSOR (see page 157), 

and, specifically, that 

the product of two tensors 

each of RANK ONE, 

gives a tensor of RANK TWO. 

In general, 

if two tensers of ranks m and n . 

respectively, 

are multiplied together, 

the result is 

a TENSOR OF RANK m + n. 

This process of multiplying tensors 

is called 

OUTER multiplication, 

166 



to distinguish it from 

another process known as 

INNER multiplication 

which is also important 

in Tensor Calculus, 

and which we shall describe later (page 183). 



XVIII. A PHYSICAL ILLUSTRATION. 

But first let us discuss 
a physical illustration of 
ANOTHER KIND OF TENSOR, 
A COVARIANT TENSOR:* 

Consider an object whose density 

is different in different parts of the object. 



A 



B 



^This is to be distinguished from the 
CONTRAVARIANT tensors 
discussed on pages 1 55ff. 

167 



We may then speak of 

the density at a particular point, A . 

Now, density is obviously 

NOT a directed quantity, 

but a SCALAR (see page 127). 

And since the density of the given object 

is not uniform throughout, 

but varies from point to point, 

it will vary as we go from A to B . 

So that if we designate by ^ 

the density at A , 

then 

^ . ^ 
-- and -"-- 
dxi dx2 

represent, respectively, 

the partial variation of \l/ 

in the xi and x> directions. 

Thus, although ^ itself is NOT 

a DIRECTED quantity, 

the CHANGE in $ DOES depend upon 

the DIRECTION 

and IS therefore a DIRECTED quantity, 
whose components are 



9xi 

Now let us see 

what happens to this quantity when 

the coordinate system is changed (see page 149). 

We are seeking to express 

d\[/ d\l/ . f d$ d\l/ 

- r , , in terms o! - , , - . 
9x1 3x2 9xi 9x 2 

Now if we have three variables, 
say^^andz, 

169 



such that y and z depend upon x , 

it is obvious that 

the change in z per unit change in x, 

IF IT CANNOT BE FOUND DIRECTLY, 

may be found by 

multiplying 

the change in y per unit change in x 

by 

the change in z per unit change in y, 

or, 

expressing this in symbols: 

f .. c/z _ cfz Jy 

(26) cfx~d[ydx- 

In our problem above, 

we have the following similar situation: 

A change in x( will affect 

BOTH xi and x 2 (see p. 145), 

and the resulting changes in XL and X2 

will affect 1/7 

hence 



Note that here we have TWO terms 

on the right 

instead of only ONE, as in (26), 

since the change in x{ 

affects BOTH xi and x 2 

and these in turn BOTH affect ty, 

whereas in (26), 

a change in x affects y/ 

which in turn affects z , 

and that is all there was to it. 

Note also that 

the curved "d" is used throughout in (27) 

since all the changes here 

170 



are PARTIAL changes 
(see footnote on page 147). 
And since ^ is influenced also 
by a change in x 2/ 
this influence may be 
similarly represented by 



And, as before, 

we may combine (27) and (28) 

by means of the abbreviated notation: 



where the occurrence of a TWICE 
in the single term on the right 
indicates a summation on a , 
as usual. 

And, finally, 

writing A^ for the two components 

4 J' W 

represented in 

C/ JC 

\ I 

and >A ff for the two components, v / 
we may write (29) as follows: 

(30) Al-jfrA. 0*^ = 

CX M 

If we now compare (30) with (16) 
we note a 

VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE, 

namely, 

that the coefficient on the right in (30) 

is the reciprocal of 

the coefficient on the right in (16), 

171 



so that (30) does NOT satisfy 
the definition of a vector given in (16). 
But it will be remembered that 
(16) is the definition of 

A CONTRAVARIANT VECTOR ONLY. 

And in (30) 

we introduce to the reader 

the mathematical definition of 

A COVARIANT VECTOR. 

Note that 

to distinguish the two kinds of vectors, 

it is customary to write the indices 

as SUBscripts in the one case 

and as SUPERscripts in the other.* 

As before (page 1 56), 

(30) may represent a vector in 

any number of dimensions, 

depending upon the range of values 

given to JJL and 0" , 

and for ANY transformation of coordinates. 

Similarly, 

A COVARIANT TENSOR OF RANK TWO 
is defined by 



and so on, for higher ranks. 

COMPARE and CONTRAST carefully 
(31) and (17). 

^Observe that the SUBscripts are used 
for the COvariant vectors, 
in which the PRIMES in the coefficients 
are in the DENOMINATORS (see (30), p. 171). 
To remember this more easily 
a young student suggests the slogan 

"CO, LOW, PRIMES BELOW/ 1 
172 



XIX. MIXED TENSORS. 

Addition of covariant vectors 
is performed in the same simple manner 
as for contravariant vectors (see p. 1 61 ) 
Thus, the SUM of 

A\ r-~7*.n a 
ox\ 

and 

Sx= dx( " 
is 

c = 3x x . 

Also, 

the operation defined on page 166 

as OUTER MULTIPLICATION 

is the same for 

covariant tensors: 

Thus, the OUTER PRODUCT of 

A( = ^-A a 
and 



is 

dx a 



Furthermore, 

it is also possible to multiply 

a COVARIANT tensor by 

a CONTRAVARIANT one, 

thus, 

173 



V 




the OUTER PRODUCT of 

A( = |J. A. 
and 

is 

(32) C/5;:= ^'-ax"' C '- 

Comparison of (32) with (31) and (17) 

shows that it is 

NEITHER a covariant 

NOR a contra variant tensor. 

It is called 

A MIXED TENSOR of rank TWO. 

More generally, 

the OUTER PRODUCT of 



and 



is 

rfr - *** * 



That is, 

if any two tensors of ranks m and n, 

respectively, 

are multiplied together 

so as to form their 

OUTER PRODUCL 

the result is a TENSOR of rank m + 

175 



thus, the rank of (33) is 3 , 

and that of (34) is 2 , 

hence, 

the rank of their outer product, (35), 

is 5. 



Furthermore, 

suppose the tensor of rank m 

is a MIXED tensor, 

having mi indices of covariance* 

and m indices of contravariancef 

(such that mi + m^ = m), 

and suppose the tensor of rank n 

has m indices of covariance* 

and n 2 indices of contravariance/f" 

then, 

their outer product will be 

a MIXED tensor having 

mi + m indices of covariance* 

and 

m2 + rt2 indices of contravariance.f 

All this has already been illustrated 

in the special case given above: 

Thus, 

(33) has ONE index of covariance (7) 

and (34) also has 

ONE index of covariance (5), 

therefore their outer product, (35), 

has TWO indices of covariance (7, <5); 

and similarly, 

since (33) has 

TWO indices of contravariance (a/ /?) 

and (34) has 

* SUBscripts. 
t SUPERscripts. 

176 



ONE index of contravariance (K), 

their outer product, (35), 

has 

THREE indices of contravariance (, /3, K) O 

We hope the reader appreciates 

the fact that 

although it takes many words 

to describe these processes 

it is extremely EASY 

to DO them 

with the AID of the 

TENSOR NOTATION. 

Thus the outer product of 

A* and B 75 
is simply C$ ! 

Let us remind him, however, that 

behind this notation, 

the processes are really complicated: 

Thus (33) represents 

a whole SET of equations* 

each having MANY* terms on the right 

And (34) also represents 

a SET of equations! 

each having MANYj terms on the right. 

And their outer product, (35), 

is obtained by 

multiplying 

*Namely, EIGHT for two-dimensional space; 
TWENTY-SEVEN for three-dimensional, 
SIXTY-FOUR for four-dimensional, 
and so on. 

tFour for two-dimensional space, 
NINE for three-dimensional space, 
SIXTEEN for four-dimensional space} 
and so on. 

177 



EACH equation of (33) by 

EACH one of (34), 

resulting in a SET of equations, (35), 

containing 

THIRTY-TWO equations for 

two-dimensional space, 

TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY-THREE for 

three-dimensional space, 

ONE THOUSAND AND TWENTY-FOUR for 

four-dimensional space, 

and so on. 

And all with a 

correspondingly large number of terms 

on the right of each equation! 

And yet 

"any child can operate it 11 

as easily as 

pushing a button. 



XX. CONTRACTION AND DIFFERENTIATION. 

This powerful and 
easily operated machine, 

the TENSOR CALCULUS, 

was devised and perfected by 

the mathematicians 

Ricci and Levi-Civita 

in about 1900, 

and was known to very few people 

until Einstein made use of it. 

Since then it has become 

widely known, 

and we hope that this little book 

will make it intelligible 

even to laymen. 

178 



But what use did Einstein make of it? 
What is its connection with Relativity? 

We are nearly ready to Fulfill 
the promise made on page 1 25. 

When we have explained 

two more operations with tensors, 

namely, 

CONTRACTION and DIFFERENTIATION, 

we shall be able to derive 

the promised CURVATURE TENSOR, 

from which 

Einstein's Law of Gravitation 

is obtained. 

Consider the mixed tensor (33), p. 175: 
suppose we replace in it 

7 by a, 
obtaining 



- 

f\<x ^~f a -\ **" 

dx a dx x dx M 

By the summation convention (p. 1 52), 

the left-hand member is to be summed on 

so that (36) now represents 

only TWO equations instead of eight,* 

each of which contains 

TWO terms on the left instead of one; 

furthermore, 

on the RIGHT, 

since a occurs twice here, 

we must sum on a 

for each pair of values of v and X : 

Now, 

*Secp. 177. 

180 



when v happens to have a value 
DIFFERENT from X, 

then 

dx, dx^ __ dx v __ 
dx f a dx x dx x 

BECAUSE 

the x's are NOT functions of each other 

(but only of the x"s) 

and therefore 

there is NO variation of x p 

with respect to 

a DIFFERENT x, namely x x . 

Thus coefficients of A? when A ^ v 

will all be ZERO 

and will make these terms drop out. 

BUT 

When A = v. 

then 

dx, dx _ dxx dx' a _ . 

dxl dx x dx' a 3x x 

Thus (36) becomes 

(37) A' = g-^ 

in which we must still 
sum on the right 
for X and M - 

To make all this clearer, 

let us write out explicitly 

the two equations represented by (37): 

'\ l + A'? = |^ (A\ l + Al l ) + ^ (Al 2 + A?) 

UXi OX'2 

!? + A'f = d f (A? + ^l 1 ) + ^ (A? + Al 2 ). 

UXi 

181 



Thus (37) may be written more briefly: 

08) c-g-e 

where 

C'^/T + ^T, 
C 2 = A'\ 2 + X? 
and 



C 2 = A[ 2 



422 



In other words, 

by making one upper and one lower index 

ALIKE 

in (33), 

we have REDUCED 

a tensor of rank THREE to 

a tensor of rank ONE. 

The important thins to note is 

that this process of reduction 

or CONTRACTION, 

as it is called/ 

leads again to 

A TENSOR, 

and it is obvious that 

foi every such contraction 

the rank is reduced by TWO, 

since for every such contraction 

two of the partial derivatives in 

the coefficient 

cancel out (see page 181). 

We shall see later 

how important this process ot contraction is. 

Now, 

if we form the OUTER PRODUCT of two tensors, 

in the way already described (p. 1 75) 

182 



and if the result is 

a mixed tensor, 

then, 

by contracting this mixed tensor 

as shown above, 

we get a tensor which is called 

an INNER PRODUCT 

in contrast to 

their OUTER PRODUCT. 

Thus the OUTER product of 
A* and B 7 

is Ck (see page 1 77); 

now, if in this result 
we replace 7 by |8 , 
obtaining 

CS, or D a (see pages 1 80 to 1 82), 

then D is an INNER product of 

A* and B\ 

And now we come to 
DIFFERENTIATION. 

We must remind the reader that 
if 

y = uv 

where // u, and v are variables, 
then 

dy _ dv j, c f?f* 

c/x c/x c/x 

Applying this principle to 
the differentiation of 

(39) A* = ^'A', 

OXff 

*See any book on differential calculus 

183 



with respect to x,' , 
we get: 



Or, since 

dA dA* dx r 



hence (40) becomes 

( 41 \ ^ = 



dx T 



From (41 ) we see that 

if the second term on the right 

were not present, 

then (41) would represent 

a mixed tensor of rank two. 

And, in certain special cases, 

this second term does vanish, 

so that 

in SUCH cases, 

differentiation of a tensor 

leads to another tensor 

whose rank is one more than 

the rank of the given tensor. 

Such a special case is the one 

in which the coefficients 



dx. 

in (39) 

are constants, 

as in (13) on page 147, 

since the coefficients in (1 3) 

are the same as those in (1 1) or (10); 

184 



and are therefore (unctions of 6 , 

6 being the angle through which 

the axes were rotated (page 141), 

and therefore a constant. 

In other words, 

when the transformation of coordinates 

is of the simple type 

described on page 141 , 

then 

ordinary differentiation of a tensor 

leads to a tensor. 

BUT, IN GENERAL, 

these coefficients are NOT constants, 
and so, 

IN GENERAL 

differentiation of a tensor 
does NOT give a tensor 
as is evident from (41). 

BUT 

there is a process called 

COVARIANT DIFFERENTIATION 

which ALWAYS leads to a tensor, 
and which we shall presently describe. 

We cannot emphasize too often 
the IMPORTANCE 

of any process which 
leads to a tensor, 
since tensors represent 
the "FACTS 11 of our universe 
(see page 149). 

And, besides, 

we shall have to employ 

COVARIANT DIFFERENTIATION 

in deriving 

185

XXI. THE LITTLE g's. 

To explain covariant differentiation 

we must first refer the reader back 

to chapter XIII; 

in which it was shown that 

the distance between two points, 

or, rather, the square of this distance, 

namely, c/s 2 , 

takes on various forms 

depending upon 

(a) the surface in question 
and 

(b) the coordinate system used. 

But now, 

with the aid of the remarkable notation 

which we have since explained, 

we can include 

ALL these expressions for c/s 2 

in the SINGLE expression 

(42) Jf = g^Jx^Jx 9ff 

and, indeed, 

this holds NOT ONLY for 

ANY SURFACE, 

but also for 

any THREE-dimensional space, 

or FOUR-dimensional, 

187 



or, in general, 

any n-dimensional space!* 

Thus, to show how (42) represents 
equation (3) on page 116, 
we take M = 1 , 2 and ^ = 1,2, 
obtaining 

(43) c/s 2 = guc/xi-c/Xi + gi>c/xrc/x 2 

g2lC/X2 ' C/Xi + g22C/X> ' C/X2 / 

since the presence of ju and P 
TWICE 

in the term on the right in (42) 

requires SUMMATION on both /* and p.f 

Of course (43) may be written: 

(44) c/s 2 = giic/x? + g, 2 c/xic/X2 + 



and, comparing (44) with (3), 
we find that 
the coefficients in (3) 
have the particular values: 

ffll = 1 I ff!2 = , jjfel = 7 22 = 

^Except only at a so-called "singular point" 

of a space/ 

that is, 

a point at which 

matter is actually located 

In other words, 

f42) holdr. for any region AROUND matter. 
Pee page 1 52. 
| Note that in c/xi (as well as in c/x:) 

the upper "2" is really an exponent 

and NOT a SUPERSCRIPT 

since (44) is an 

ordinary algebraic equation 

and is NOT in the 

ABBREVIATED TENSOR NOTATION. 
188 



Similarly, in (6) on page 120, 

gu = r\ ffi2 = , g 2 i = , 322 = /?* / 
and, in (7) on page 123, 

gn =* 1, 912 ^ - cos a, g 2 i = -cos a, g 2 2 = 1, 
and so on. 

Note that gi2 and g?i have 
the SAME value. 
And indeed, in general 

9?" = 9w 
in (42) on page 187. 

Of course, if, in (42), 

we take /*- 1,2, 3 and ^=1,2, 3, 

we shall get the value for c/s 2 

in a THREE-dimensional space: 

(45) c/s 2 = guc/xi + gi2C/xrc/x 2 + gisc/xrc/xs 
4- g>2]dx2-dxi + 



Thus, in particular, 

for ordinary Euclidean three-space, 

using the common rectangular coordinates, 

we now have: 

gn = 1 , g22 = 1 / gas = 1 / 
and all the other g's are zero, 
so that (42) becomes, 

for THIS PARTICULAR CASE, 
the familiar expression 

c/s 2 = c/x? + c/xl + c/xi 

c/s 2 = c/x 2 + c/y 2 + c/z 2 / 

and similarly for 
higher dimensions. 

189 



Thus/ for a given space/ 
two-, three-, four-, or n-dimensional, 
and for a given set of coordinates, 
we get a certain set of g's. 

It is easy to show* that 

any such set of g's, 

(which is represented by gv) 

constitutes 

the COMPONENTS of a TENSOR, 

and; in fact, that 

COVARIANT TENSOR OF RANK TWO, 

and hence is appropriately 
designated with TWO SUBscriptsf: 



Let us now briefly sum up 
the story so far: 

By introducing 

the Principle of Equivalence 

Einstein replaced the idea of 

a M force of gravity" 

by the concept of 

a geometrical space (Chap. XII). 

And since a space 

is characterized by its g's, 

the knowledge of the g's of a space 

is essential to a study of 

how things move in the space, 

and hence essential 

to an understanding of 

Einstein's Law of Gravitation. 

*Seep.313. 
tSeep.172. 

190 



XXII. OUR LAST DETOUR 

As we said before (page 185), 

to derive the 

Einstein Law of Gravitation, 

we must employ 

COVARIANT DIFFERENTIATION. 

Now, the COVARIANT DERIVATIVE of a terror 

contains certain quantities known as 

CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS* 

which are functions of the tensor g^ 

discussed in chapter XXI, 

and also of another set g^ 

(note the SUPERscripts here) 

which we shall now describe: 

For simplicity, 

let us limit ourselves for the moment 

to TWO-dimensional space, 

that is, 

let us take /x = 1 , 2 and v = 1 , 2 ; 

then g MV will have 

FOUR components, 

namely, 

the four coefficients on the right 

in (44). 

And let us arrange these coefficients 

in a SQUARE ARRAY, thus: 



ff21 ff22 I 

which is called a MATRIX. 

Now since gt2 = 921 (see page 1 89) 

*Named for the mathematician, Christoffcl. 

191 



this is called a 

SYMMETRIC MATRIX, 

since it is symmetric with respect to 

the principal diagonal 

(that is, the one which starts 

in the upper left-hand corner). 

IF we now replace the double bars 

on each side of the matrix 

by SINGLE bars, 

as shown in the following: 



we get what is known as 
a DETERMINANT.* 
The reader must carefully 
DISTINGUISH between 

*The reader probably knows that 
a square array of numbers 
with single bars on each side 

5 6 
2 3 

is called a determinant, 

and that its value is found thus: 

5X3-6X2 = 15-12- 
Or, more generally, 

at I I 

c J =*- 

A determinant does not necessarily 
have to have TWO rows and columns, 
but may have n rows and n columns, 
and is then said to be of order n . 
The way to find the VALUE of 
a determinant of the nth order 
is described in any book on 
college algebra. 

193 



a square array with SINGLE bars 
from one with DOUBLE bars: 

The FORMER is a DETERMINANT 

and has a SINGLE VALUE 

found by combining the "elements" 

in a certain way 

as mentioned in the foot-note on p. 193. 

Whereas 

the DOUBLE-barred array 

is a set of SEPARATE "elements," 

NOT to be COMBINED in any way. 

They may be just 

the coefficients of the separate terms 

on the right in (44), 

which, 

as we mentioned on page 1 90, 

are the separate COMPONENTS of a tensor. 

The determinant on page 193 
may be designated more briefly by 

! g. I , Oi = 1 , 2 / v = 1 , 2) 

or, still better, simply by g. 

And now let us form a new square array 
in the following manner: 

DIVIDE the COFACTOR* of EACH ELEMENT 

of the determinant on page 193 

by the value of the whole determinant, 

namely, by g, 

thus obtaining the corresponding element of 

the NEW array. 

*For readers unfamiliar with determinants 
this term is explained on p. 195. 

194 



The COFACTOR of a given element 

of a determinant 

is found by striking out 

the row and column containing the given element, 

and evaluating the 

determinant which is left over, 

prefixing the sign + or 

according to a certain rule: 

Thus, in the determinant 

523 
4 1 
6 8 / 

the cofactor of the element 5, is: 



1 
8 7 



= 1X7-8X0 = 7-0 = 7. 



Similarly, the cofactor of 4 is: 



2 3 
8 7 



= -(14 -24) = 10; 



and so on. 

Note that in the first case 

we prefixed the sign + , 

while in the second case 

we prefixed a . 

The rule is: 

prefix a + or according as 

the NUMBER of steps required to go 

from the first element 

(that is, the one in 

the upper left-hand corner) 

to the given element, 

is EVEN or ODD, respectively/ 

thus to go from "5" to "4" 

it takes one step, 

hence the cofactor of "4" must have 

a MINUS prefixed before 

2 3 

8 7 ' 

But all this is more thoroughly 
explained in any book on 
college algebra. 

195 



Let us now 90 back 
to the array described 
at the bottom of p. 194. 

This new array, 

which we shall designate by g" p 

can also be shown to be 

a TENSOR, 

and, this time, 

A CONTRAVARIANT TENSOR 

OF RANK TWO. 

That it is also SYMMETRIC 

can easily be shown by the reader. 

We can now give the definition 
of the Christoffel symbol 
which we need. 
It is designated by {^v, \] 

and is a symbol for: 



In other words, 

the above-mentioned Christoffel symbol : 

involves partial derivatives of 

the coefficients in (44), 

combined as shown in (46) 

and multiplied by 

the components of the tensor g^ . 

Thus, in two-dimensional space, 

*There arc other Christoffel symbols, 
but we promised the reader 
to introduce only the 
barest minimum of mathematics 
necessary for our purpose! 

196 



since M , v , X , a each have the values 1 , 2 , 
we have, for example, 



(11 1) - a 11 4- 9n - 9n 

* I I / I { <J I i 1-1 ^T 

2 \dxi dxi dxi 



12 

2 g 



and similarly (or the remaining 
SEVEN values of 



obtained by allowing M , v and X 
to take on their two values for each. 

Note that in evaluating {11 ; 1 } above, 

we SUMMED on the a, 

allowing a to take on BOTH values, 1,2, 

BECAUSE 

if (46) were multiplied out, 

EACH TERM would contain a TWICE, 

and this calls for 

SUMMATION on the a (see page 1 52). 

Now that we know the meaning of 

the 3-index Christoffel symbol 



X}, 

we are ready to define 
the covariant derivative of a tensor, 
from which it is only a step to 
the new Law of Gravitation. 

If Ar is a covariant tensor of rank one, 
its COVARIANT DERIVATIVE 
with respect to x r 

is DEFINED as: 

(47) dA. . } . 

^-{r,aM.. 

197 



It can be shown to be a TENSOR 
in fact/ it is a 

COVARIANT TENSOR OF RANK TWO* 
and may therefore be designated by 

A, T . 

Similarly, 

if we have 

a contravariant tensor of rank one, 

represented by A a , 

its COVARIANT DERIVATIVE 
with respect to x, 
is the TENSOR: 

< 48 > K. +ln . r] *. 

Or, 

starting with tensors of rank TWO, 

we have the following three cases: 

(a) starting with the 

CONTRAVARIANT tensor, 4", 

we get the COVARIANT DERIVATIVE: 



(b) from the MIXED tensor, A:, 

we get the COVARIANT DERIVATIVE: 



',*See p. 60 of 

"The Mathematical Theory of Relativity/ 1 by 
A. S. Eddington, 
the 1930 Edition. 

198 



(c) from the COVARIANT tensor, A. T , 

we set the COVARIANT DERIVATIVE: 

A A 

Arrp = -jT^ - {*P/ *} Ar - \Tp / *} A, . 
UXp 

And similarly (or the 

COVARIANT DERIVATIVES 
of tensors of higher ranks. 

Note that IN ALL CASES 
COVARIANT DIFFERENTIATION 
OF A TENSOR 
leads to a TENSOR having 
ONE MORE UNIT OF 
COVARIANT CHARACTER 
than the given tensor. 

Of course since 

the covariant derivative of a tensor 

is itself a tensor, 

we may find 

ITS covariant derivative 

which is then the 

SECOND COVARIANT DERIVATIVE of 

the original tensor, 

and so on for 

higher covariant derivatives, 

Note also that 

when the g's happen to be constants, 

as, for example, 

in the case of a Euclidean plane, 

using rectangular coordinates, 

in which case we have (see p. 1 88) 



so that 

flfll = I / l2 = , ff21 = , 22 

199 



all constants, 

then obviously 

the Christoffel symbols here 

are all ZERO, 

since the derivative of a constant is zero, 

and every term of the 

Christoffel symbol 

has such a derivative as a factor/ 

so that (47) becomes simply ~~ . 



That is, in this case, 
the covariant derivative becomes 
simply the ordinary derivative. 
But of course 

this is NOT so IN GENERAL 



XXIII. THE CURVATURE TENSOR AT LAST. 

Having now built up the necessary machinery, 
the reader will have no trouble 
in following the derivation of 
the new Law of Gravitation. 

Starting with the tensor, A, , 
form its covariant derivative 
with respect to x r : 

(49) A = d - K!A.(seep.197). 

*See page 196. 

200 



Now form the covariant derivative 
of AT (see page 1 99) 
with respect to x p : 

(50) A rp = d - !<rp, e) A, - [rp, ej A,. 



obtaining 

a SECOND covariant derivative of A a , 

which is a 

COVARIANT TENSOR 

OF RANK THREE. 

Substituting (49) in (50), 
we get 



A l/ ^ff ( ) ^^a A ^ < ) 

A,,, = T.-*- ~ ( ffr '/ i ^7" - A i {"/ "I 

UJ\p v/JCp 

9A , 



or 



dA, 



o 4 



202 



If we had taken these derivatives 

in the REVERSE order, 

namely, 

FIRST with respect to x p 

and THEN with respect to x r , 

we would of course have obtained 

the following result instead: 



|f ) 3 A 

M<rT ' } ax~ 

+ {<7T,e} {tp,a} A. 

f ) Vf\a ,f ) ( ) l 

- {pT'tlfc + !P T / ) l (T6 / a l A, 

which is again 

a COVARIANT TENSOR OF RANK THREE 

Now, 

comparing (51) with (52) 

we shall find that they are 

NOT alike THROUGHOUT: 

Only SOME of the terms are the 

SAME in both, 

but the remaining terms are different. 

Let us see: 

the FIRST term in each is: 

3 2 Ar j d~A ff , 

V- ^-~ and T ,- , respectively. 
dx T dx p dx p dx/ 

These, by ordinary calculus, 
203 



ARE the same.* 

The SECOND term of (51) 

is the same as 

the FOURTH term of (52) 

since the occurrence of a (or e) 

TWICE in the same term 

implies a SUMMATION 

and it is therefore immaterial 

what letter is used (a or e) ! f 

Similarly for 

the FOURTH term of (51) 

and the SECOND of (52). 

The SIXTH term (and the SEVENTH) 

is the same in both 

since the reversal of r and p in 



*For, suppose that z is a (unction of x and / , 
as, for example, z x 2 + 2xy, 

Then . = 2x + 2y (treating y as constant) 

and v v" = 2 (treating x as constant). 

dx-dy 

And, if we reverse the order of differentiation, 
finding FIRST the derivative with respect to y 
and THEN with respect to x , 
we would get 

Y = 2x (treating x as constant) 

\0 

and 7, 2 (treating y as constant) 

dydx 

the SAME FINAL result. 
And this is true IN GENERAL. 

t An index which is thus easily replaceable is called a 
"dummy"! 

204 



does not alter the value of 

this Christoffel symbol: 

This can easily be seen by referring 

to the definition of this symbol;* 

and remembering that the tensor g M , 

is SYMMETRIC, 

that is, ft, g, M (see page 1 89). 

Similarly the last term is the same 
in both (51) and (52). 

But the THIRD and FIFTH terms of (51) 
are NOT equal to any of the terms in (52). 

Hence by subtraction we get 

\ 

} {^ f } A* A a { 

ox p 



or 
(53) 



And since addition (or subtraction) 

of tensors 

gives a result which is itself a tensor (see page 161) 

the left-hand member of (53) is 

A COVARIANT TENSOR OF RANK THREE, 

hence of course the right-hand member 

is also such a tensor. 

But, now, 

since A n is an arbitrary covariant vector, 

*Seepa 9 e196. 

205 



its coefficient; 

namely; the quantity in square brackets, 

must also be a tensor 

according to the theorem on p. 31 2. 

Furthermore, 

this bracketed expression 

must be a MIXED tensor of RANK FOUR, 

since on inner multiplication by A. 

it must give a result which is 

of rank THREE; 

and indeed it must be of the form 



(see page 31 3). 

This 

AT LAST 

is the long-promised 

CURVATURE TENSOR ( P a 8 e187), 

and is known as 

THE RIEMANN-CHRISTOFFEL TENSOR. 

Let us examine it carefully 
so that we may appreciate 
its meaning and value. 



XXIV. OF WHAT USE IS THE CURVATURE 
TENSOR? 

In the first place 
we must remember that 
it is an abbreviated notation for 
the expression in square brackets 
in (53) on page 205; 
in which, 

if we substitute for the Christoffel symbols, 
206 



(crp, e} and so on, 

their values in accordance with 

the definition on page 196, 

we find that we have 

an expression containing 

First and second partial derivatives 

of the g's , 

which are themselves the coefficients 

in the expression for c/s 2 (see p. 1 87) 

How many components does 

the Riemann-Christoffel tensor have? 

Obviously that depends upon the 

dimensionality of the space 

under consideration. 

Thus, if we are studying 

a two-dimensional surface, 

then each of the indices, 

will have two possible values, 

so that B* TP would then have 

sixteen components. 

Similarly, 

in three-dimensional space 

it would have 3 4 or 81 components, 

and so on. 

For the purposes of Relativity, 

in which we have to deal with 

a FOUR-dimensional continuum 

this tensor has 4 4 or 256 components! 

We hasten to add that 

it is not quite so bad as that, 

as we can easily see: 

In the first place, 

if, in this tensor,* 

*That is, in the expression in square brackets 
in (53) on page 205. 

207 



we interchange r and p , 

the result is merely to change its sign.J 

Hence, 

of the possible 16 combinations of r and p , 

only 6 are independent: 

This is in itself so interesting 

that we shall linger here for a moment: 

Suppose we have 16 quantities, a,, ;j , 

(wherea= 1 , 2, 3 7 4, and - 1,2,3,4), 

which we may arrange as follows: 



a-2t 322 a23 324 
ast 332 a;j;} 331 
641 ^42 ^43 44 

And suppose that a a)3 = a fta 

(that is, a reversal of the two subscripts 

results only in a change of sign of the term), 

then, since a n = an implies that an = , 

and similarly for the remaining terms 

in the principal diagonal, 

hence, 

the above array becomes: 





323 

324 



324 



Thus there are only 
SIX distinct quantities 
instead of sixteen. 
Such an array is called 

ANTISYMMETRIC. 

tThc reader would do well to compare this expression 
with the one obtained from it by an interchange of r and 
p throughout. 

208 



Compare this with the definition of 

a SYMMETRIC array on page 193.J 

And so, 

to come back to the discussion on page 208, 

we now have 

six combinations of r and p 

to be used with 

sixteen combinations of <r and a, 

giving 6 X 16 or 96 components 

instead of 256. 

Furthermore, 

it can be shown 

that we can further reduce this number 

to 20.* 

Thus our curvature tensor, 

for the situation in Relativity, 

has only 20 components and NOT 256! 

Now let us consider for a moment 
the great IMPORTANCE of this tensor 
in the study of spaces. 

fThus in an ANTISYMMETRIC matrix we have 

ap = a/3 , 
whereas, in a SYMMETRIC matrix we have 



Note that if the first matrix on p. 208 
were SYMMETRIC, 
it would reduce to 
TEN distinct elements, 
since the elements in the principal diagonal 
would NOT be zero in that case. 
*See A. S. Fddington's 
The Mathematical Theory of Relativity, 
page 72 of the 1930 edition. 

209 



Suppose we have 

a Euclidean space 

of two, three, or more dimensions, 

and suppose we use 

ordinary rectangular coordinates. 

Here the g*s are all constants.* 

Hence, 

since the derivative of a constant 

is zero 

the Christoffel symbols will 

also be zero (see page 200); 

and, therefore, 

all the components of the 

curvature tensor 

will be zero too, 

because every term contains 

a Christoffel symbol (see page 205). 

BUT, 

if the components of a tensor 

in any given coordinate system 

are all zero, 

obviously its components in 

any other coordinate system 

would also be zero 

(consider this in the simple case on page 129) c 

And so, 

whereas from a mere superficial inspection 

of the expression for cfe 2 

we cannot tell whether 

the space is Euclidean or not,! 

an examination of the curvature tensor 

(which of course is obtained 

from the coefficients 

in the expression for c/s 2 ) 

*Sec page 1 89. 
JScc page 1 25. 

210 



can definitely give this information, 

no matter what coordinate system 

is used in setting up cfs 2 . 

Thus, 

whether we use (3) on page 116 

or (7) or (8) on page 123, 

all of which represent 

the square of the distance 

between two points 

ON A EUCLIDEAN PLANE, 

using various coordinate systems, 

we shall find that 

the components of B" Tp in all three cases 

ARE ALL ZERO.* 

The same is true 

for all coordinate systems 

and for any number of dimensions, 

provided that we remain in 

Euclidean geometry. 



*To have a clear idea of 
the meaning of the symbolism, 
the reader should try the simple exercise 
of showing that B? TP = for (8) on p. 123. 
He must bear in mind that here 

911 = 1, 312 = g-2i = o, gfc^xj, 

and use these values in the bracketed expression 

in (53) on page 205, 

remembering of course that the meaning of [ap 1 1] , etc. 

is given by the definition on page 196; 

also that all indices, <r , p , c , etc. 

have the possible values 1 and 2, 

since the space here is 

two-dimensional; 

and he must not forget to SUM 

whenever an index appears 

TWICE IN ANY ONE TERM. 
211 



Thus 

(54) B; rp = 

is a NECESSARY condition 
that a space shall be 
EUCLIDEAN. 

It can be shown that 

this is also a SUFFICIENT condition. 

In other words, 

given a Euclidean space, 

this tensor will be zero, 

whatever coordinate system is used,. 

AND CONVERSELY, 

given this tensor equal to zero, 

then we know that 

the space must be Euclidean. 

We shall now see 

how the new Law of Gravitation 

is EASILY derived 

from this tensor. 



XXV. THE BIG G'S OR EINSTEIN'S LAW 
OF GRAVITATION. 

In (54) replace p by a , 
obtaining 

(55) B a = 0. 

Since a appears twice 

in the term on the left, 

we must, , 

according to the usual convention, 

sum on a, 

213 



t\ 




V 



so that (55) represents 

only SIXTEEN equations 

corresponding to the 

4X4 values of <r and r 

in a four-dimensional continuum. 

Thus, when er = r = 1 7 

(55) becomes 

Bin + Bin + Bin + B?u = 0. 

Similarly for <r = 1 , r = 2 , 
we get 

0121 + Bl22 + Bi23 + Bi24 = 

and so on, 

for the 16 possible combinations of <r and r 

We may therefore write (55) in the form 

(56) G ffr = 

where each G consists of 4 B's 

as shown above. 

In other words, 

by CONTRACTING B,' rp , 

which is a tensor of the FOURTH rank, 

we get a tensor of the SECOND rank, 

namely, G ffT , 

as explained on page 182. 

The QUITE INNOCENT-LOOKING 

EQUATION (56) IS 

EINSTEIN'S LAW OF GRAVITATION. 

Perhaps tht reader is startled 

by this sudden announcement. 

But let us look into (56) 

carefully, 

and see what is behind its 

innocent simplicity, 

215 



and why it deserves to be called 
the Law of Gravitation. 

In the first place 

it must be remembered 

that before contraction, 

B*rt> 

represented the quantity in brackets 

in the right-hand member 

of equation (53) on page 205. 

Hence, 

when we contracted it 

by replacing p by a , 

we can see from (53) that 

Gar represents 

the following expression: 

\ r\ 

(57) {era, e} (er, a} - ^ {<"", a] + {aa, a] 

- {err,*} {,<*}, 
which, in turn, 
by the definition of 
the Christoffel symbol (page 196) 
represents 

an expression containing 
first and second partial derivatives 
of the little g's. 
And, of course, 
(57) takes 16 different values 
as <r and r each take on 
their 4 different values, 
while the other Creek letters in (57), 
namely, a and e, 
are mere dummies (see page 204) 
and are to be summed 
(since each occurs twice in each term), 
as usual. 

216 



To get clearly in mind 

just what (57) means, 

the reader is advised 

to replace each Christoffe! symbol 

in accordance with the definition on page 196, 

and to write out in particular 

one of the 16 expressions represented by (57) 

by putting, say <r = 1 and r = 2 , 

and allowing a and 6 to assume, 

in succession, 

the values 1,2, 3 ,4. 

It can easily be shown 

that (56) actually represents 

NOT 16 DIFFERENT equations 

but only 10, 

and, of these, only 6 are independent.* 

So that the new Law of Gravitation 

is not quite so complicated 

as it appears at first. 

But why do we call it a 
Law of Gravitation at all? 

It will be remembered 

that a space, 

of any number of dimensions, 

is characterized by 

its expression for cfs 2 (see page 187). 

Thus 

(56) is completely determined by 

the nature of the space which, 

by the Principle of Equivalence 

determines the path 

of a freely moving object 

in the space. 

*Se p. 242. 

217 



But, even granting the 

Principle of Equivalence, 

that is, 

granting the idea 

that the nature of the space, 

rather than a "force 11 of gravity, 

determines how objects (or light) 

move in that space 

in other words, 

granting that the g's alone 

determine the Law of Gravitation 

one may still ask: 

Why is this particular expression (56) 

taken to be the 

Law of Gravitation? 

To which the answer is that 

it is the SIMPLEST expression which is 

ANALOGOUS to Newton's Law of Gravitation. 

Perhaps the reader is unpleasantly surprised 

at this reply, 

and thinks that the choice has been 

made rather ARBITRARILY! 

May we therefore suggest to him 

to read through the rest of this book 

in order to find out 

the CONSEQUENCES of Einstein 1 * choice 

of the Law of Gravitation. 

We predict that he will be convinced 

of the WISDOM of this choice,* 

and will appreciate that this is 

part of Einstein's GENIUS! 

*The reader who is particularly 
interested in this point 
may wish to look up a book called 
"The Law of Gravitation in Relativity" 
by Levinson and Zeisler, 1931. 

218 



He will see, for example, on page 271 , 

that the equations giving 

the path of a planet, 

derived by Newton, 

are the SAME, to a first approximation, 

as the Einstein equations, 

so that the latter can do 

ALL that the Newtonian equations do, 

and FURTHERMORE, 

the ADDITIONAL term in (84) 

accounts for the "unusual" path 

of the planet Mercury, 

which the Newtonian equation (85) 

did not account for at all. 

But we are anticipating the story! 

Let us now express Newton's Law in 

a form which will show the analogy clearly. 



XXVI. COMPARISON OF EINSTEIN'S LAW 
OF GRAVITATION WITH NEWTON'S. 

Everyone knows that, 
according to Newton,* 
two bodies attract each other 
with a force which is proportional 
to the product of their masses, 
and inversely proportional to the 
square of the distance between them, 
thus: 



*See the chapter on the 
"Theory of Attractive Forces*' in 
Ziwet and Field's 
Introduction to Analytical Mechanics, 

219 



In this formula 

we regard the two bodies, 

of masses mi and m > , 

as each concentrated at a single point * 

(its "center of gravity 11 ), 

and r is then precisely 

the distance between these two points. 

Mow we may consider that mi 

is surrounded by a "gravitational field* 5 

in which the gravitational force at A 

(see the diagram on page 221) 

is given by the above equation. 

If we divide both sides by m% 

we get 

_F_ __ fc/m 

1 ~ o~~ 
ni2 r" 

And, according to Newton, 

= a , the acceleration with which 

/3l2 

m> would move due to 
the force F acting on it. 
We may therefore write 



(58) 



a = 



where the constant C now includes 

since we are speaking of 

the gravitational field around mi . 

*Thus it is a fact that 
to support a body 
it is not necessary to 
hold it up all over, 
but one needs only support it 
right under its center of gravity, 
as if its entire mass 
were concentrated at that point. 

220 



Now, acceleration is a vector quantity/* 
and it may be split up into components:! 
Thus take the origin to be at mi , 
and the mass 012 at A i 




then OA = r; 

and let AB represent the acceleration at A 
(since m 2 is being pulled toward mi) 
in both magnitude and direction. 
Now if X is the x-component of a , 
it is obvious that 



Therefore 



X 

a 



x 

r' 



Or, better, 



*See page 127. 
fSee page 129. 



221 



to show that the direction of X is to the left. 
Substituting in this equation 
the value of a from (58) 
we get: 

y - ^* 
A - - 7 - 

And, similarly, 

y = -- 3 - and, in 3-dimensional space, 

we would have also Z = -- p 
By differentiation, we get: 



dx r 6 

But, since r 2 = x 2 + y 2 + z 2 
(as is obvious from the diagram 
on page 131 , if AB = r), 

i dr x 

then = - ' 

dx r 

Substituting this in the above equation, 
it becomes 



dx r 6 

And, similarly, 



From these we get: 

(59) 3X,ay,az 

_ [- TV" 
ox ay az 

222 



This equation may be written: 
(60) dV , ^ , * 

ax 2 "*" a/ 2 "*" dz 2 

where is a (unction such that 



and is called the 

"gravitational potential 1 */ * 

obviously (60) is merely another way 

of expressing the field equation (59) 

obtained from 

Newton's Law of Gravitation. 

This form of the law, namely (60), 

is generally 'known as 

the Laplace equation 

and is more briefly denoted by 

v 2 ^ - 

where the symbol V 2 merely denotesf 

that 

the second partial derivatives 

with respect to x , y , and z , 

respectively, 

are to be taken and added together, 

as shown in (60). 

We see from (60), then, 

that the gravitational field equation 

obtained from 

Newton's Law of Gravitation 

is an equation containing 

the second partial derivatives 

of the gravitational potential. 

* See footnote on page 21 9. 
fThe symbol V is read "nabla", 
and V 2 is read *'nabla square". 

223 



Whereas (56) is 

a set of equations 

which also contain 

nothing higher than 

the second partial derivatives 

of the g's, 

which, 

by the Principle of Equivalence, 

replace the notion of 

a gravitational potential 

derived from the idea of 

a "force 11 of gravity, 

by the idea of 

the characteristic property of 

the SPACE in question (see Ch. XII). 

It is therefore reasonable 

to accept (56) as the 

gravitational field equations 

which follow from the idea of 

the Principle of Equivalence. 

HOW REASONABLE it is 
will be evident 
when we test it by 
EXPERIMENT! 

It has been said (on page 21 5) 

that each G consists of four B'S O 

Hence, 

if the B's are all zero, 

then the G's will all be zero; 

but the converse 

is obviously NOT true: 

Namely, 

even if the G's are all zero, 

it does not necessarily follow 

that the B's are zero. 

925 



But we know that, 

to have the fi's all zero 

implies that 

the space is Euclidean (see p. 213). 

Thus, 

if the condition for Euclidean space 

is fulfilled, 

namely, 

B a = 

Off T p ~ V / 

then G<r T = automatically follows/ 
thus 



is true in the special case of 
Euclidean space. 
But, more than this, 
since 



does NOT NECESSARILY imply 

that the fi's are zero, 
hence 



can be true 

EVEN IF THE SPACE IS 

NOT EUCLIDEAN, 

namely, 

in the space around a body which 

creates a gravitational field. 

Now all this sounds very reasonable, 

but still one naturally asks: 

"How can this new 

Law of Gravitation 

be tested EXPERIMENTALLY?" 

226 



Einstein suggested several ways 

in which it might be tested. 

and, 

as every child now knows/ 

when the experiments were 

actually carried out, 

his predictions were all fulfilled, 

and caused a great stir 

not only in the scientific world, 

but penetrated even into 

the daily news 

the world over. 

But doubtless the reader 

would like to know 

the details of these experiments/ 

and just how the above-mentioned 

Law of Gravitation 

is applied to them. 

Thai is what we shall show next. 



XXVII. HOW CAN THE EINSTEIN LAW OF 
GRAVITATION BE TESTED? 

We have seen that 
G, r = 

represents Einstein's new 
Law of Gravitation/ 
and consists of 6 equations 
containing partial derivatives of 
the little g's.* 

*See pages 21 5 to 21 7. 

227 




,u 



In order to test this law 

we must obviously substitute in it 

the values of the g's which 

actually apply in our ohysical world; 

in other words, 

we must know first 

what is the expression for d* 

which applies to our world 

(see Chapter XIII). 

Now, if we use 

the customary polar coordinates, 

we know that 

in two-dimensional EUCLIDEAN space 

we have 

c/s 2 = c/r 2 + rW.* 
Similarly, 

for three-dimensional 
EUCLIDEAN space 
we have the well-known: 

c/s 2 = c/r 2 + rW + r 2 sinW</> 2 
The reader can easily derive this from 

c/s 2 - c/x? + Jxl + Jx] (on pa g c 189), 

by changing to polar coordinates 
with the aid of the diagram 
on page 230. 

*See page 123 



229 




where 



xi = x = 01 = OMcos <t> 

= r cos / POM cos </> = r sin ^ cos < 
X2 = y = LM = OM sin < = r sin sin 
xs = z = PM = r cos 0. 



And, 

for 4-dimensional space-time 



230 



we have 

fc/s 2 = - Jr 2 - rW - fWe/fl-cfy 2 + 
(61 a) or 

[c/s 2 = - c/x? - xl^ - x?sinVc/xi -f c/xi 

(where xi = r, x 2 = 9, x 3 = 0, x 4 = t 7 
and c is taken equal to 1), 
as we can readily see: 

Note that the general form for 

four-dimensional space 

in Cartesian coordinates, 

analogous to the 3-dimensional one on p. 189, 

c/s 2 = Jx 2 + dy 2 + </z 2 + c/r 2 . 

But 7 on page 67 

we showed that 

in order to get 

the square of an "interval" in 

space-time 

in this form/ 

with all four plus signs, 

we had to take r NOT equal to 

the time, t, 

BUT to take T = - ict* where 



i = 

c = the velocity of light; 

from which 

c/r 2 = - cW, 

and the above expression becomes: 



*As a matter of fact, 
in "Special Relativity, 11 
we took r = it, 
but that was because 
we also took c = 1/ 
otherwise, we must take r = ict. 

231 






V 




And, furthermore, 

since in actual fact, 

c 2 c/t 2 is always found to be 

Sreater than (</x 2 + c/y 2 + c/z 2 ), 

therefore, 

to make c/s come out reel instead of imaginary, 

it is more reasonable to write 

c/s 2 = -c/x 2 -Jy 2 -c/z 2 +cW, 

which in polar coordinates, 
becomes (61 a). 

The reader must clearly realize that 

this formula still applies to 

EUCLIDEAN space-time, 

which is involved in 

the SPECIAL theory of Relativity* 

where we considered only 

observers moving with 

UNIFORM velocity relatively to each other. 

But now, 

in the GENERAL theory (page 96) 

where we are considering 

accelerated motion (page 102), 

and therefore have a 

NON-EUCLIDEAN space-time 

(see Chapter XII), 

what expression for c/s 2 

shall we use? 

In the first place 

it is reasonable to assume that 

(61 b) Js 2 = - e* </x? - e* (xldxl + 

+ e'c/x 

(where Xi , X2 / Xa / X4 represent 

*See Part I of this book. 

233 



the polar coordinates r, 0, $, and t, 

respectively, 

and A , IJL , and v are (unctions of xi only), 

BECAUSE: 

(A) we do not include product terms 
of the form cfxi cfa , 
or, more generally, 
of the form dx ff c/x r where cr ^ r , 
(which ARE included in (42), p. 187) 
since 

from astronomical evidence 
it seems that 
our universe is 

(a) ISOTROPIC and 

(b) HOMOGENEOUS: 
That is, 

the distribution of matter 
(the nebulae) 
is the SAME 

(a) IN ALL DIRECTIONS and 

(b) FROM WHICHEVER POINT WE LOOK. 

Now, 

how does the omission of terms like 

dx ff Jx T where <r ^ r 

represent this mathematically? 

Well, obviously, 

a term like c/rc/0 

(or C/0-C/0 or c/rc/(/>) 

would be different 

for 6 (or </> or r) positive or negative, 

and, consequently, 

the expression for c/s 2 

would be different if we turn 

in opposite directions 

234 



which would contradict the 

experimental evidence that 

the universe is ISOTROPIC 

And of course the use of 

the same expression for c/s 2 

from ANY point 

reflects the idea of HOMOGENEITY. 

And so we see that it is reasonable 

to have in (61 b) 

only terms involving c[0 2 , c[</> 2 , c/r 2 , 

in which it makes no difference 

whether we substitute +c/0 or c/0, etc. 

Similarly, 

since in getting a measure for c/s 2 / 

we are considering 

a STATIC condition, 

and not one which is changing 

from moment to moment, 

we must therefore not include 

terms which will have different values 

for +dtand -c/f/ 

in other words, 

we must not include 

product terms like c/rc/t, etc, 

In short 

\we must not have any terms involving 
cfx^-c/Xr where or ^T, 

but only terms involving 

dx ff -dx r where (7 = T. 

(B) The factors e x , e M , e", are inserted 
in the coefficients * 
to allow for the fact 

*Cf.(61a)and(61b). 

235 



that our space is now 
NON-EUCLIDEAN. 

Hence they are so chosen as to 

allow freedom to adjust them 

to the actual physical world 

/since they are variables), 

jnd yet 

iheir FORM is such that 

it will be easy to manipulate them 

in making the necessary adjustment- 

as we shall see.* 

Now, 

(61 b) can be somewhat simplified 

by replacing 

e*x? by (x() 2 , 

and taking x( as a new coordinate, 
thus getting rid of e" entirely/ 
and we may even drop the prime, 
since any change in c/xi which arises 
from the above substitution 
can be taken care of 
by taking X correspondingly different. 
Thus (61 b) becomes, more simply, 

(62) c/s 2 = - e\/x? - xldxl - xrsinWx 2 . + e'-c/x 4 2 

And we now have to find 
the values of the coefficients 

e x and e" 
in terms of xi.j 

^Further justification for (61 b) 

may be found in 

R. C. Tolman's 

Relativity Thermodynamics & Cosmology, 

p. 239 ff. 
ISee page 934. 

236 



We warn the reader that this is a 

COLOSSAL UNDERTAKING, 

but, in spite of this bad news, 

we hasten to console him by 

telling him that 

many terms will reduce to zero, 

and the whole complicated structure 

will melt down to almost nothing; 

we can then apply the result 

to the physical data 

with the greatest ease. 

To any reader who "can't take it 1 ' 

we suggest that 

he omit the next chapter 

and merely use the result 

to follow 

the experimental tests of the 

Einstein Law of Gravitation 

given from page 255 on. 

BUT HE WILL MISS A LOT OF FUN! 



XXVIII. SURMOUNTING THE DIFFICULTIES. 

So far, then, 

we have the following values: 

SLI = * x / ff22 = - x? , g 33 = - x?sin 2 x 2 , g 44 = e* 

and g ar = when cr ^ r. (see (62) on p. 236.) 

Furthermore, 

the determinant g (see page 194) 

is simply equal to 

the product of the four elements in 

its principal diagonal, 

237 



since ail the other elements are zero: 



-e x 














x 2 











o 1 


Xi$in 


2 x 2 











e" 



Hence 

Also 7 in this case, 

and 

g* T = when a ^ r. f 

We shall need these relationships 
in determining e* and e in (62). 

Now we shall see 

how the big G's will help us to 

Find the little g's 

and how the little g's will help us 

to reduce the number of big G's 10 

ONLY THREE! 

First let us show that 
the set of quantities 



is SYMMETRIC,}: 
and therefore 

*See the chapter on determinants 
in any college algebra, 
to Find out how to evaluate 
a determinant of the fourth order. 

tSee the definition of g M " on page 196. 

{Seepage 193. 

239 



G ar = reduces to TEN equations * 

instead of sixteen/ 

as v and r each take on 

their values 1 ,2/3,4. 

To show this, 

we must remember that 

G ffT really represents (57) on p. 216; 

and let us examine {act, a} 

which occurs in (57): 

By definition (page 196), 



But, 

remembering that 

the presence of a and c TWICE 

in EACH term 

(after multiplying out) 

implies that we must SUM on a and e 

the reader will easily see that 

many of the terms will cancel out 

and that we shall qet 



Furthermore, 

by the definition of g" v on page 196, 

the reader may also verify the fact that 



i dg = 1 dg 
2ff 



where g is the determinant of p. 239. 
And, from elementary calculus, 

*See pase 193. 

240 



/} = :->- log v-gr. 




Similarly, 



Substituting these values in (57), 
we get: 

<\ 
(63) G ffT = {era, e} {er, a} - jar, aj + 




We can now easily see 
that (63) represents 
10 equations and not sixteen/ 
(or the following reasons: 
In the first place/ 

{er, a] = {re, a} (see pp. 204, 205). 
Hence, 

by interchanging a and r , 
the first term of (63) remains unchanged, 
its two factors merely change places 

*Notc that _ 

we might also have obtained V + g, 
but since g is always negative 
(we shall show on p. 252 that X = -y, 
and therefore g on p. 239 becomes xi 4 -sin 2 X2) 
it is more reasonable to select v g f which 
will make the Christoffel symbols, 
and hence also the terms in 
the new Law of Gravitation, 
REAL rather than imaginary. 

241 



(since and a are mere dummies, 

as explained on page 204). 

And, 

the second, third and fourth terms of (63) 

are also unchanged by 

the interchange of a and r. 

in other words, 



Thus, if we arrange 
the 16 quantities in G JT 
in a square array: 

Gn Gi2 Gis G 

vJ21 tf22 VJ23 \3 
Gsi Gs2 633 G 
G41 642 Gl3 6 

We have just shown that 

this is a SYMMETRIC matrix.* 

Hence (63) reduces to 10 equations 

instead of 1 6 , 

as we said before. 

We shall not burden the reader 

with the details of 

how (63) is further reduced 

to only SIX equations.! 

But perhaps the reader is thinking 

that "only six" equations 

are still no great consolation, 

particularly if he realizes 

*See page 239. 
flf he is interested, 

he may look this up on page 115 of 

M The Mathematical Theory of Relativity/ 1 

by A. S. Eddington, 

the 1930 edition. 

24* 



how long each of these equations is ! 

But does he realize this? 

he would do well to take 

particular values of cr and r , 

say <r = 1 , and r = 1 , 

in order to see just what 

ONE of the equations in (63) 

is really like! 

(don't forget to sum on the dummies I) 

Is the reader wondering 

just what we are trying to do to him? 

Is this a subtle mental torture 

by which we 

alternately frighten and console him? 

The fact is that 

we do want to frighten him sufficiently 

to make him realize 

the colossal amount of computation 

that is involved here, 

and yet to keep up his courage too 

by the knowledge that 

it does eventually boil down 

to a really simple form. 

He might not appreciate 

the final simple form 

if he did not know 

the labor that produced it. 

With this apology, 

we shall now proceed to indicate 

how the further simplification 

takes place. 

In each Christoffel symbol in (63), 
we must substitute specific values 
for the Greek letters. 
It is obvious then 

243 



that there will be four possible types: 
(a) those in which the values of 

all three Greek letters are alike: 

Thus: ffo- g a} 



0-<r , r 

or , r 



(b) those of the form 

(c) those of the form 
and 

(d) those of the form {err , p}. 

Note that it is unnecessary to consider 

the form {rer, r} 

since this is the same as (or, r} (see p. 204). 

Now, by definition (page 196), 



and, as usual, 

we must sum on a. 

But since the only g's which are not zero 

are those in which 

the irrdices are alike (see p. 237) 

and, in that case, 

flT*=1/ff~ (P- 239). 
Hence 

f _ } _ jL( d S 4- d 9~ d 9~ \ 
(jcr, a } ^'l v~ -r ~^- --- - I 

2g (T Adx <y 5x ff 3x,/ 
and therefore 



which, by elementary calculus, gives 

(a) {<r<r,<r} = ^ ^ log g ro . 

244 



Similarly, 

*"-' = Mi!*-" + 1- -H- 

2 Vox, dx, dx a / 

Here the only values of a that 

will keep the outside factor g ra from being zero 

are those for which a = T , 

and since r ^ a 

(for otherwise we should have case (a) ) 

we get 



or 

/L\ 

(b) 

Likewise 



(c) {CTT.T} = g ^ log g rr 
and 

(d) {<rr /P }=0. 

Let us now evaluate these various forms 

for specific values: 

Thus, take, in case (a), cr = 1 : 

1 r) 

Then {11/1} = g ^7 lo 33n 

Butgn= -c x (Seep. 239). 
hence {11 f i}=l.|og(-O 
which, by elementary calculus, gives 



245 



L V 4 

where A represents - or / 

6x1 dr 

since xi = r (see page 233), 
Similarly, 

in, i4 if *-J 

But, since 

in taking a PARTIAL derivative 

with respect to one variable, 

all the other variables are held constant, 

hence 



and therefore 

(22,2} =0. 
And, likewise, 

{33 ,3) = {44,41=0. 

Now, for case (b), 

take first (r = 1 , r = 2 / 

then 

{11 , 2} = - ^ gn = - ~ ~- 
x 2 2flL> 2 3x2 



But, since X is a function of x\ only/ 
and is therefore held constant 
while the partial derivative 
with respect to x> is taken, 
hence {11,2} =0, 
and so on. 

Let us see how many specific values 

we shall have in all. 

Obviously (a) has 4 specific cases, 

*Se page 234. 

246 



namely, <r = 1 ,2,3,4, 

which have already been evaluated above. 

(b) will have 12 specific cases, 

since for each value of a = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 
r can have 3 of its possible 4 values 
(for here a ^ r) / 

(c) will also have 12 cases, 
and 

(d) will have 4 X 3 X 2 = 24 cases, 

but since {or , p} = [TV , p\ (see p. 204), 
this reduces to 1 2. 

Hence in all 
there are 40 cases. 

The reader should verify the fact that 
31 of the 40 reduce to zero, 
the 9 remaining ones being

Now, in (63), 

when we give to the various Greek letters 

their possible values, 

we find that, 

since so many of the ChristofFel symbols 

are equal to zero, 

a great meny (over 200) terms drop out ! 

And there remain now 

only FIVE equations, 

each with a much smaller number of terms. 

These are written out in full below, 

and, 

lest the reader think that 

this is the promised 

final simplified result, 

we hasten to add that 

the BEST is yet to come! 

Just how Gii is obtained, 

showing the reader how 

to SUM on a. and e 

and which terms drop out 

(because they contain zero factors} 

will be found in V, 

on page 31 7. 

And, 

similarly (or the other G's. 

Here we give 

the equations which result 

after the zero terms have been 

eliminated.

and 612 becomes: 

- cotfl - - cotfl = 
r r 

which is identically zero 

and therefore drops out, 

thus reducing the number of equations 

to FOUR. 

Note also that 

633 includes 622 , 

so that these two equations 

are not independent 

hence now the equations are 

THREE. 

And now, dividing G 4 4 by e*~ x 
and adding the result to Gn , 
we get 

(65) A' = - / 

d\ dv 

or T" = ~ T" ' 

or dr 

Therefore, by integration, 

(66) A = - v + I 

where / is a constant of integration. 

But, since 

at an infinite distance from matter, 

our universe would be Euclidean,* 

*See page 226. 

251 



and then, (or Cartesian coordinates, 
we would have: 



that is, 

the coefficient of c/x? and of dx\ 

must be 1 under these conditions/ 

hence, 

if (61 b) is to hold also for 

this special case, 

as of course it must do, 

we should then have A = , v = 0. 

In other words, 

since, 

when v = , X also equals , 

then, from (66), / , too, must be zero. 

Hence 

(67) \=-v. 

Usins (65) and (67), 

622 on page 250 becomes 

(68) e'(1 +n/) = 1. 

If we put 7 = e , 

and differentiate with respect to r , 

we get 

dy _ v dv 



_ v 

^~ e " 
or dr 



or 



Hence (68) becomes 
(69) 7 + f y = 1. 

*See pages 189 and 231. 

252 



This equation may now be 
easily integrated/ 
obtaining 

(70) T = 1 - ~ 

where 2m is a constant of integration. 
The constant m will later be shown 
to have an important physical meaning. 

Thus we have succeeded in finding 

x and 



e an e' 



*From elementary theory of 
differential equations, 
we write (69): 



or 



or 

cf T_ = -Jr 

1-7 r ' 

Having separated the variables, 
we can now integrate both sides 
thus: 

log (1 7) = - log r + constant; 
or 

log r (1 7) = constant, 

and therefore 

r (1 7) = constant. 
We may then write 

r (1 - 7) = 2m , 
from which we get 



A 2m 
7 = 1 . 



253 



in terms of xi : 

e" = 1/e x =7 = 1- 2m/r = 1 - 2/n/x, 

and (62) becomes: 

(71 ) ctf = - 7 -i</ r 2 - r V0 2 - r 2 sin 2 c/</ 

where, as before (p. 233), 

r = xi / = x 2 , = x 3 , t = x 4 . 

And hence 

the new Law of Gravitation, 

consisting now of only 

the THREE remaining equations: 

Gn = , G 3 3 = , and G 4 4 = , 

are now fully determined by 
the little g s of (71). 

We can now proceed 

to test this result 

to see whether it really applies 

to the physical world we live in. 



XXIX. "THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING. 11 

The first test is naturally 

to see what 

the new Law of Gravitation 

has to say about 

the path of a planet. 

It was assumed by Newton that 

a body "naturally 1 * moves 

along a straight line 

255 



if it is not pulled out of its course 

by some force acting on it: 

As, for example, 

a body moving on 

a frictionless Euclidean plane. 

Similarly, 

according to Einstein 

if it moves "freely 11 on 

the surface of a SPHERE 

it would 30 along the 

"nearest thing to a straight line/ 1 

that is, 

along the GEODESIC for this surface, 

namely, 

along a great circle. 

And, for other surfaces, 

or spaces of higher dimensions, 

it would move along 

the corresponding geodesic for 

the particular surface or space. 

Now our problem is 

to find out 

what is the geodesic in 

our non-Euclidean physical world, 

since a planet must move 

along such a geodesic. 

In order to find 

the equation of a geodesic 

it is necessary to know 

something about the 

"Calculus of Variations/ 1 

so that we cannot go info details here. 

But we shall give the reader 

a rough idea of the plan, 

together with references where 

257 



he may look up this matter further.* 

Suppose, For example, that 

we have given 

two points, A and B , on a 

Euclidean plane,- 

it is obviously possible to 

join them by various paths, 

thus: 




B 



Now, 

which of all possible paths 

is the geodesic here? 

Of course the reader knows the answer: 

It is the straight line path. 

But how do we set up 

the problem mathematically 

so that we may solve 

similar problems in other cases? 

*(1) For fundamental methods see 
"Calculus of Variations/' by 
G. A. Bliss. 

(2) For this specific problem see 
"The Mathematical Theory of 
Relativity/ 1 by A. S. Eddington, 
p. 59 of the 1930 edition. 

(3) Or see pages 128-1 34 of 

"The Absolute Differential Calculus/ 1 
by T. Levi-Civita. 

258 



Well, 

we know from ordinary calculus 

that 

if a short arc on 

any of these paths 

is represented by c/s , 

then f. B 

f A 

J A 

represents the total length of 

that entire path. 

And this of course applies to 

any one of the paths from A to B. 

How do we now select from among these 

the geodesic? 

This problem is similar to 
one with which the reader is 
undoubtedly familiar, 
namely, 

if y = f(x), 

find the values of y for which 

y is an "extremum" or a "stationary. 16 

Such values of y are shown in 
the diagram on the next page 
at a , 6 , and c: 



259 




a 



and/ (or all these/ we must have 

dy/dx = 
or 

(72) <fr=ffo)-c/x = 
where x, is a , 6 , or c. 

Similarly/ 

to go back to our problem on pp. 258 and 259, 

the geodesic we are looking for 

would make 

r B 
f A 

JA 

a stationary. 
This is expressed in 
the calculus of variations by 

(73) f c/s - 

JA 

analogously to (72). 

To find the equation of the geodesic/ 

satisfying (73), 

is not as simple as finding 

260 



a maximum or minimum in 
ordinary calculus, 
and we shall give here 
only the result:* 

(74) + W ., 



Let us consider (74): 

In the first place, 

for ordinary three-dimensional 

Euclidean space 

a would have 

three possible values: 1,2,3, 

since we have here 

three coordinates xi, X2, x 3 / 

furthermore, 

by choosing Cartesian coordinates, 

we would have (see page 1 89): 

ffll == 522 = ff33 = 1 

and 

& = for /i ^ v 

and therefore 



which involves derivatives of the g'sf 
would be equal to zero, 
so that (74) would become 



(75) ~ 

*For details, look up the references in 
the footnote on p. 258. 
fSee (46) on p. 196. 

261 



Now, if in (75) 

we replace c/s by dt * 

it becomes 



(76) = -0 (* = 1,2,3) 

which is a short way of writing 
the three equations: 

/ 77 \ 
(77) 



But what is 

the PHYSICAL MEANING of (77)? 

*lf we consider an observer who 
has chosen his coordinates 
in such a way that 

C/Xl = C/X2 = C/X3 = 9 

in other words, 

an observer who is traveling with 

a moving object, 

and for whom the object is therefore 

standing still with reference to 

his ordinary space-coordinates, 

so that only time is changing for him, 

then, for him (61 a) becomes 

c/s 2 = c/x 4 2 
or c/s 2 = c/t 2 
or c/s = c/t. 

That is to say, 

c/s becomes of the nature of "time/" 

for this reason 

c/s is often called 

"the proper time" 

since it is a "time" 

for the moving object itself. 

262 



Why, everyone knows that, 
(or uniform motion, 

v=s/t, 

where v is the velocity with which 

a body moves when 

it goes a distance of 5 feet in 

t seconds. 

If the motion is NOT uniform, 

we can, by means of 

elementary differential calculus, 

express the velocity AT AN INSTANT, 

by 

v = ds/dt . 

Or, if x, /, and z are 

the projections of s on the 

X, Y, and Z axes, respectively, 

and v x , v y , and v z are 

the projections of v 

on the three axes, 

then 

_ e/x _ dy __ di 

~ ~ 



in the abridged notation, 

v, = ^ ('=1,2, 3) 

where we use xi, X2 , Xs 

instead of x , y , z , 

and vi , v 2 , va instead of v x ,v v ,Vz' 

Furthermore, 

since acceleration is 

the change in velocity per unit of time, 

263 



we have 

Jv 



or 

(78) a =^ tr-1 2 3) 

<T 1.2 V* * I * / */ 

Thus (77) states that 

the components of the acceleration 

must be zero, 

and hence the acceleration itself 

must be zero, thus: 



or 



From this we set, by integrating, 

v = a constant, 
or 

-r = a constant, 

and therefore 

by integrating again, 

s = at+ b, 

which is the equation of 
A STRAIGHT LINE. 

In other words, 

when the equations for a geodesic, 

namely, (74), 

are applied to the special case of 

THREE-DIMENSIONAL EUCLIDEAN SPACE, 

they lead to the (act that 

264 



in this special case 

THE GEODESIC IS A STRAIGHT LINE! 

We hope (he reader is DELIGHTED 

and NOT DISAPPOINTED 

to get a result which is 

so familiar to him; 

and we hope it gives him 

a friendly feeling of confidence 

in (74)! 

And of course he must realize 

that (74) will work also 

for any non-Euclidean space, 

since it contains 

the little g's 

which characterize the space/* 

and for any dimensionality, 

since cr may be given 

any number of values. 

In particular, 

in our four-dimensional 

non-Euclidean world, 

(74) represents 

the path of an object moving 

in the presence of matter 

(which merely makes the space 

non-Euclidean), 

with no external force acting upon the object; 

and hence (74) is 

THE PATH OF A PLANET 

which we are looking for! 



*Seep. 190. 

265 



XXX. MORE ABOUT THE PATH OF 
A PLANET. 

Of course (74) is only 
a GENERAL expression, 
and does not yet apply to 
our particular physical world, 
since the Christoffel symbol 



involves the g's, 

and is therefore not specific until 
we substitute the values of the g's 
which apply in a specific case 
in the physical world. 

Now in (64) 

we have the values of \a/3 , a} 

in terms of X , v , r and 0. 

And, by (67), A - - v , 

hence we know {&$ , <?} in terms of 

v , r and 6. 

Further, since e" = 7 (see page 252) 
and 7 is known in terms of r from (70), 
we therefore have [ct$ f a} in terms of 

r and 0. 

The reader must bear in mind 

that 

whereas (76), in Newtonian physics, 

represents only three equations, 

on the other hand, 

(74) in Einsteinian physics 

is an abridged notation for 

FOUR equations, 

266 



as <J takes on 

its FOUR possible values: 1,2,3,4. 

Taking first the value a = 2 , 

and, remembering that x 2 = (see page 233), 

we have, 

(or one of the equations of (74), 

the following: 

/-rn\ a . f ^ dx a dxa ^ 

(79) 2 +{^} = - 



And now, 

since a and /? each occur 

TWICE 

in the second term, 

we must sum on these as usual, 

so that we must consider terms 

containing, respectively, 

{11,2}, {12,2}, [13,2}, {14,2}, 
{21,2}, {22,2}, {23,2}, {24, 2}, etc 

in which a always equals 2 , 

and a and /3 each runs its course 

from 1 to 4. 

But, from (64), we see that 

most of these are zero, 

the only ones remaining being 



and 

{33,2} = - sin0-co$0. 

Also, by page 204, 

{21,2} = {12,2}. 
267 



Thus (79) becomes 

fftfYk <PO 1 dr dd ,/</</> Y 

(80) + -.._.- tm fl. eoi .. =0. 



If we now choose our coordinates 

in such a way 

that 

an object begins moving in the plane 

6 = 7T/2 , 

then 



-j- = and cos0 = 
di 



and hence 



If we now substitute all these values in (80), 

we see that this equation is satisfied, 

and hence = ir/2 is a solution of the equation, 

thus showing that 

the path of the planet 

is in a plane. 

Thus from (80) 

we have found out that 

a planet, 

according to Einstein, 

must move in a plane, 

just as in Newtonian physics. 

Let us now examine (74) further, 
and see what 

the 3 remaining equations in it 
tell us about planetary motion: 

263 



For <T = 1 , 
(79) becomes 



Or 



But since we have chosen 6 = 7r/2 , 
then 

In 

~-r = and sin0 = 1 , 
hence this equation becomes 



And similarly, 
for a- = 3 , 
(79) sives 



( 82 ) 

as 2 r as as 

and for cr = 4 , 
we get 

(83) ^ +F f** o. 

or as as 

269 



And now 

from (81), (82), (83), and (71), 

tosether with (70), 

we get* 



(84) 



c/ 2 u , ___ m 

W A 5 



== n 



where c and h are 
constants of integration, 
and u 1/r. 

Thus (84) represents 

the path of an object moving freely, 

that is, 

not constrained by any external force, 

and is therefore, 

in a sense, 

analogous to a straight line in 

Newtonian physics. 

But it must be remembered 

that in Einsteinian physics, 

owing to the 

Principle of Equivalence (Chapter XI), 

an object is 

NOT constrained by any external force 

even when it is moving in 

the presence of matter, 

as, for example, 

a planet moving 

around the sun. 

And hence (84) 

would represent the path of a planet. 

*For details see page 86 in 
"The Mathematical Theory of Relativity/' by 
A. S. Eddington (the 1930 edition). 

270 



From this point of view 

we are not interested in 

comparing (84) with 

the straight line motion in 

Newtonian physics, 

as mentioned on page 270, 

but rather with 

the equations representing 

the path of a planet 

in Newtonian physics, 

in which, of course, 

the planet is supposed to move 

under the 

GRAVITATIONAL FORCE 

of the sun. 

it has been shown 

in Newtonian physics 

that a body 

moving under a "central force/ 1 

(like a planet moving 

under the influence of the sun) 

moves in an ellipse, 

with the central force (the sun) 

located at one of the foci.* 



And the equations of this path are: 

m 
TO 

* 



(85) 



e/ 2 u , __ m 
jLTsi ~r u - TO 



* " * 



where r is the distance 
from the sun to the planet, 
m is the mass of the sun, 

*Sec Ziwct and Field: "Mechanics/* 
or any other book on mechanics. 

271 



a is the semi-major-axis of the ellipse, 
4> is the angle swept out by the planet 
in time t. 

We notice at once 

the remarkable resemblance between 

(84) and (85). 

They are indeed 

IDENTICAL EXCEPT for 

the presence of the term 3mu 2 , 

and of course the use of 

</s instead of dt in (84).* 

Thus we see that 

the Newtonian equations (85) 

are really 

a first approximation to 

the Einstein equations (84); 

that is why 

they worked so satisfactorily 

for so long. 

Let us now see 

how the situation is affected by 

the additional term 3mir. 



XXXI. THE PERIHELION OF MERCURY. 

Owing to the presence of the term 

3mu 2 

(84) is no longer an ellipse 
but a kind of spiral 
in which the path 
is NOT retraced 
each time the planet 

*See p. 262. 

272 



makes a complete revolution, 
but is shifted as shown 
in the following diagram: 




in which 

the "perihelion/* that is, 

the point in the path 

nearest the sun, S, at the focus/ 

is at A the first time around/ 

at 6 the next time/ 

at C the next/ 

and so on. 

273 



In other words, 

a planet does not 30 

round and round 

in the same path, 

but there is a slight shift 

in the entire path, 

each time around. 

And the shift of the perihelion 

can be calculated 

by means of (84).* 

This shift can also be 

MEASURED experimentally, 

and therefore can serve 

as a method of 

TESTING 

the Einstein theory 

in actual fact. 

Now it is obvious that 

when a planetary orbit 

is very nearly CIRCULAR 

this shift in the perihelion 

is not observable, 

and this is unfortunately 

the situation with 

most of the planets. 

There is one, however, 

in which this shift 

IS measurable, 

namely, 

the planet MERCURY. 

Lest the reader think 
that the astronomers 

*For details see aqain 
Eddington's book referred to 
in the footnote of page 270. 

274 



can make only 

crude measurements, 

let us say in their defense, 

that the discrepancy 

even in the case of Mercury 

is an arc of 

ONLY ABOUT 

43 SECONDS PER CENTURY! 

Let us make clear what we mean by 

"the discrepancy: 19 

when we say that 

the Newtonian theory 

requires the path of a planet to be 

an ellipse, 

it must be understood that 

this would hold only if 

there were a SINGLE planet; 

the presence of other planets 

causes so-called "perturbations," 

so that 

even according to Newton 

there would be 

some shift in the 

perihelion. 

But the amount of shift 

due to this cause 

has long been known to be 

531 seconds of arc per century, 

whereas observation shows 

that the actual shift is 

574 seconds, 

thus leaving a shift of 

43 seconds per century 

UNACCOUNTED FOR 

in the Newtonian theory. 

Think of the DELICACY 

275 



of the measurements 
and the patient persistence 
over a long period of years 
by generations of astronomers 
that is represented 
by the above figure! 
And this figure was known 
to astronomers 
long before Einstein. 
It worried them deeply 
since they could not account 
for the presence of this shift. 

And then 

the Einstein theory, 

which originated in the attempt 

to explain 

the Michelson-Morley experiment,* 

and NOT AT ALL with the intention 

of explaining the shift 

in the perihelion of Mercury, 

QUITE INCIDENTALLY EXPLAINED 

THIS DIFFICULTY ALSO, 

for the presence of the term 3mu' in (84) 

leads to the additional shift of perihelion 

of 42.9" ! | 



XXXII. DEFLECTION OF A RAY OF LIGHT. 

We saw in the previous chapter 
that the experimental evidence 

*See Part I.: the Special Theory of Relativity. 
fFor the details of the calculation which leads 

from (84) to this correction of perihelion shift, 

see p. 88 of the 1930 edition of 

"The Mathematical Theory of Relativity/ 1 by 

A. S. Eddington. 

276 



in connection with 

the shift of the perihelion of Mercury 

was already at hand 

when Einstein's theory was proposed, 

and immediately served 

as a check of the theory. 

Let us now consider 

further experimental verification 

of the theory, 

but this time 

the evidence did not precede 

but was PREDICTED BY 

the theory. 

This was in connection with 
the path of a ray of light 
as it passes near a large mass 
like the sun. 

It will be remembered that 

according to the Einstein theory 

the presence of matter in space 

makes the space non-Euclidean 

and that the path of anything moving freely 

(whether it be a planet 

or a ray of light) 

will be along a geodesic 

in that space, and therefore 

will be affected by the presence 

of these obstacles in space. 

Whereas, 

according to classical physics, 

the force of gravitation 

could be exerted 

only by one mass (say the sun) 

upon another mass (say a planet), 

but NOT upon a ray of light. 

277 



Here then was 

a definite difference in viewpoint 

between the two theories, 

and the facts should 

decide between them. 

For this it was necessary 

to observe 

what happens to a ray of light 

coming from a distant star 

as it passes near the sun 

is it bent toward the sun, 

as predicted by Einstein, 

or does it continue on 

in a straight line, 

as required by classical physics? * 

Now it is obviously impossible 

to make this observation 

under ordinary circumstances, 

since we cannot look at a star 

whose rays are passing near the sun, 

on account of the brightness of the sun itself: 

Not only would the star be invisible, 

but the glare of the sun 

would make it impossible 

to look in that direction at all. 

And so it was necessary 
to wait for a total eclipse, 

*lf, however, light were considered 
to be a stream of incandescent particles 
instead of waves, 
the sun WOUL6 have 
a gravitational effect upon 
a ray of light, even by classical theory, 



a ray 



the AMOUNT of deflection 
calculated even on this basis, 
DOES NOT AGREE with experiment, 
as we shall show later (see p. 287). 

278 



when the sun is up in the sky 

but its glare is hidden by the moon, 

so that the stars become 

distinctly visible during the day. 

Therefore, at the next total eclipse 

astronomical expeditions were sent out 

to those parts of the world 

where the eclipse could be 

advantageously observed/ 

and, 

since such an eclipse 

lasts only a few seconds, 

they had to be prepared 

to take photographs of the stars 

rapidly and clearly, 

so that afterwards, 

upon developing the plates/ 

the positions of the stars 

could be compared 

with their positions in the sky 

when the sun is NOT present.

when the sun is NOT 

in that part of the sky. 

And, also, 

when the sun IS present, 

and the ray is deflected 

and becomes ACF , 

280 



so that, 

when viewed from F, 

the star APPEARS to be at B. 

Thus, 

if such photographs 

could be successfully obtained, 

AND IF they showed 

that all the stars 

in the part of the sky near the sun 

were really displaced (as from A to B) 

AND IF 

the MAGNITUDE of the displacements 

agreed with the values 

calculated by the theory, 

then of course 

this would constitute 

very strong evidence in favor of 

the Einstein theory. 

Let us now determine 

the magnitude of this displacement 

as predicted by the Einstein theory: 

We have seen (on page 233) 

that 

in the "Special Theory of Relativity/ 1 

which applies in EUCLIDEAN space-time, 

c/s 2 - cW - (c/x 2 + c/y 2 + c/z 2 )/ 

if we now divide this expression by cfc 2 , 
we get 



but 



Jx c/y </z 

"~T i ~~r i ~~r are 



281 



the components of the velocity, v , of 

a moving thing (see p. 263), 

then obviously the 

above quantity in brackets is v 2 , 

and the above equation becomes: 



= c 



Now when 

the "moving thing 1 * happens to be 

a light-ray, 

then v = c , 

and we get, FOR LIGHT, 

c/$ = 0. 

But what about our 
NON-EUCLIDEAN world, 

containing matter? 

It will be remembered (see p. 118) 

that in studying a 

non-Euclidean two-dimensional space 

(namely, the surface of a sphere) 

in a certain small region, 

we were aided by 

the Euclidean plane which 

practically coincided with 

the given surface in 

that small region. 

Using the same device for 

space of higher dimensions, 

we can, 

in studying a small region of 

NON-Euclidean four-dimensional space-time, 

such as our world is, 

also utilize the 

EUCLIDEAN 4-dimensionaI space-time which 

282 



practically coincides with it 
in that small region. 
And hence 



will apply FOR LIGHT even 

in our NON-EUCLIDEAN world. 

And now, 

using this result in (71), 

together with the condition (or A 

a geodesic, on page 261 , 

we shall obtain 

THE PATH OF A RAY OF LIGHT. 



XXXIII. DEFLECTION OF A RAY OF 
LIGHT (Continued) 

In chapters XXIX and XXX we showed that 

the condition for a geodesic 

given on page 260 

led to (74), 

which, together with 

the little g's of (71) 

gave us the path of a planet, (84). 

And now, 

in order to find 

the path of A RAY OF LIGHT, 
we must add the further requirement: 

c/s = 0, 

as we pointed out in Chapter XXXII. 

Substituting c/s in 

the second equation of (84), 

283 



we get 



which changes the 
first equation of (84) to 



which is the required 

PATH OF A RAY OF LIGHT. 

And this, 

by integration* 

gives, in rectangular coordinates, 



+ y 2 

for the equation of the curve on 
page 280. 

Now, since a (page 280) is 

a very small angle, 

the asymptotes of the curve may be 

found by taking y very large by 

comparison with x , 

and so, 

neglecting the x terms on the right 

in the above formula, 

it becomes 



And, 

*For details see page 90 of 
A. S. Eddinston's 

"The Mathematical Theory of Relativity/' 
the 1930 edition. 

284 



using the familiar formula for 
the angle between two lines 
(see any book on Analytics): 



__ mi iii2 
tan OL ~~~ f 



where a is the desired angle, 
and mi and m> are 
the slopes of the two lines, 
we get 

4/?m 
tana = 



4m 2 -fl 2 
from which it is easy to find 

4m 



. 
sin a - 



R + 4m2/R 



And, a being small, 

its value in radian measure is 

equal to sin a * 

so that 

we now have 

/O/A 4m 

(86) a = R + 4mVR - 

Now, 

what is the actual value of a 
in the case under discussion, 
in which 

R = the radius of the sun 
and 

m is its mass? 

*For the proof of this see 
any book on calculus, 
or look up a table of 
trigonometric functions. 

285 



Since R = 697,000 kilometers, 
and m = 1.47 kilometers f 
4m 2 may be neglected by 
comparison with /?, 
so that (86) reduces to the 
very simple equation: 

4m 



from which we easily get 

a = 1 .75 seconds. 

In other words, 

it was predicted by 

the Einstein theory 

that, 

a ray of light passing near the sun 

would be bent into a curve (ACF), 

as shown in the figure on p. 280, 

and that, 

consequently 

a star at A would 

APPEARtobeatB, 

a displacement of 

an angle of 1.75 seconds! 

If the reader will stop a moment 

to consider 

how small is an angle of 

even one DEGREE, 

and then consider that 

one-sixtieth of that is 

an angle of one MINUTE, 

and again 

one-sixtieth of that is 

tSee page 315. 

286 



an angle of one SECOND, 
he will realize how small is 
a displacement of 1 .75 seconds! 

Furthermore, 

according to the Newtonian theory,* 

the displacement would be 

only half of that! 

And it is this TINY difference 

that must distinguish 

between the two theories. 

After all the trouble that 

the reader has been put to, 

to find out the issue, 

perhaps he is disappointed to learn 

how small is the difference 

between the predictions of 

Newton and Einstein. 

And perhaps he thinks that 

a decision based on 

so small a difference 

can scarcely be relied upon! 

But we wish to point out to him, 

that, 

far from losing his respect and faith 

in scientific method, 

he should, 

ON THE CONTRARY, 

be all the more filled with 

ADMIRATION AND WONDER 

to think that 

experimental work in astronomy 

IS SO ACCURATE 

that 

*See the footnote on p. 278. 
287 



these small quantities* are measured 

WIFH PERFECT CONFIDENCE, 

and that they 

DO distinguish 

between the two theories and 

DO decide in favor of the 

Einstein theory, 

as is shown by the 

following figures: 

The British expeditions, in 1919, 

to Sobral and Principe, 

gave for this displacement: 

1.98" 0.1 2" 
and 

1.61 "0.30", 

respectively; 

values which have since been 

confirmed at other eclipses, 

as, for example, 

the results of Campbell and Trumpler, 

who obtained, 

using two different cameras, 

1.72" 0.11" and 1.82" 0.1 5", 

in the 1922 expedition of the 
Lick Observatory. 

So that by now 
all physicists agree that 
the conclusions are 
beyond question. 

*See also the discrepancy in 
the shift of the perihelion 
of Mercury, 
on page 275. 

288 



We cannot refrain, 

in closing this chapter, 

from reminding the reader that 

191 9 was right after World War I, 

and that 

Einstein was then classified dS 

a GERMAN scientist, 

and yet, 

the British scientists, 

without any of the 

stupid racial prejudices then 

(and alas! still) 

rampant in the world, 

went to a great deal of trouble 

to equip and send out expeditions 

to test a theory by 

an "enemy. 11 



XXXIV. THE THIRD OF THE "CRUCIAL 11 
PHENOMENA. 

We have already seen that 

two of the consequences from 

the Einstein theory 

were completely verified by 

experiment: 

(1) One, concerning the shift of 
the perihelion of Mercury, 
the experimental data for which 
was known long before Einstein 

BUT NEVER BEFORE EXPLAINED. 

And it must be remembered 
that the Einstein theory was 

289 



NOT expressly designed to 
explain this shift, 
but did it 

QUITE INCIDENTALLY! 

(2) The other, concerning the bending 

of a ray of light as it 

passes near the sun. 

It was never suspected 

before Einstein that 

a ray of light when passing 

near the sun 

would be bent.* 

It was for the first time 

PREDICTED by this theory, 

and, to everyone's surprise, 

was actually verified 

by experiment, 

QUANTITATIVELY as well as 

QUALITATIVELY (see Chap. XXXIII). 
Now there was still another 
consequence of this theory which 
could be tested experimentally, 
according to Einstein. 
In order to appreciate it 
we must say something about spectra. 

Everyone probably knows that 

if you hang a triangular glass prism 

in the sunlight, 

a band of different colors, 

like a rainbow, 

will appear on the wall where 

the light strikes after it has 

come through the prism. 

The explanation of this phenomenon 

*But, see the footnote on p. 278. 
290 



is quite simple, 

as may be seen from the diagram: 




A 



When a beam of white light, SD, 

strikes the prism ABC, 

it does NOT continue in 

the SAME direction, D, 

but is bent.* 

Furthermore, 

if it is "composite" light, 

like sunlight or any other white light, 

which is composed of 

light of different colors 

(or different wave-lengths), 

*This bending of a light ray 
is called "refraction," 
and has nothing to do with 
the bending discussed in Ch. XXXIII. 
The reader may look up "refraction" 
in any book on elementary physics. 

291 



each constituent 

bends a different amount; 

and when these constituents 

reach the other side, BC, of the prism, 

they are bent again, 

as shown in the diagram on p. 291, 

so that, 

by the time they reach the wall, XY , 

the colors are all separated out, 

as shown, 

the light of longest wave-length, 

namely, red, 

being deflected least. 

Hence the rainbow-colored spectrum. 

Now, obviously, 

if the light from 5 is 

"monochromatic/ 1 

that is, 

light of a SINGLE wave-length only, 

instead of "composite," 

like sunlight, 

we have instead of a "rainbow/* 

a single bright line on XY , 

having a DEFINITE position, 

since the amount of bending, 

as we said above, 

depends upon the color or wave-length 

of the light in question. 

Now such monochromatic light 

may be obtained from 

the incandescent vapor 

of a chemical element 

thus sodium, when heated, 

burns with a light of 

a certain definite wave-length, 

characteristic of sodium. 

292 



And similarly (or other elements. 

This is explained as follows: 

The atoms of each element 

vibrate with a certain 

DEFINITE period of vibration, 

characteristic of that substance, 

and, in vibrating, cause 

a disturbance in the medium around it, 

this disturbance being 

a light-wave of definite wave-length 

corresponding to 

the period of vibration, 

thus giving rise to 

a DEFINITE color 

which is visible in 

i DEFINITE position in the spectrum. 

And so, 

if you look at a spectrum 

you can tell from the bright lines in it 

just what substances 

are present at 5. 

Now then, 

according to Einstein, 

since each atom has 

a definite period of vibration, 

it is a sort of natural clock 

and should serve as 

a measure for an "interval" c/s. 

Thus take c/s to be 

the interval between 

the beginning and end of one vibration, 

and eft the time this takes, 

or the "period" of vibration; 

then, using space coordinates 

such that 

dr= S = d<t> = 0, 

293 



that is, 

the coordinates of an observer 

for whom the atom is vibrating at 

the origin of his space coordinates 

(in other words, 

an observer traveling with the atom), 

equation (71) becomes 

<tf = yd? or c/s= Vydt, 

2/n 
where 7 = 1 --- (see p. 253). 

Now, 

if an atom of, say, sodium 

is vibrating near the sun, 

we should have to substitute 

for m and r 

the mass and radius of the sun/ 

and, similarly, 

if an atom of the substance is 

vibrating near the earth, 

m and r would then have to be 

the mass and radius of the earth, 

and so on: 

Thus 7 DEPENDS upon 

the location of the atom. 

But since ds is 

the space-time interval between 

the beginning and end of a vibration, 

as judged by an observer 

traveling with the atom, 

c/s is consequently 

INDEPENDENT of the location 

of the atom/ 

then, since 



294 



obviously eft would have to be 
DEPENDENT UPON THE LOCATION. 

Thus, 

though sodium from a source 

in a laboratory 

gives rise to a line in 

a definite part of the spectrum, 

on the other hand, 

sodium on the sun, which, 

according to the above reasoning, 

would have a 

DIFFERENT period of vibration, 

and hence would emit light of a 

DIFFERENT wave-length, 

would then give a bright line in a 

DIFFERENT part of the spectrum 

from that ordinarily due to sodium. 

And now let us see 

HOW MUCH of a change in 

the period of vibration 

is predicted by the Einstein theory 

and whether it is borne out 

by the facts: 

If Jt and dt' represent 

the periods of vibration near 

the sun and the earth, 

respectively, 

then 



or

Now Tearth is very nearly 1 ; 
hence 

cfc 1 



& V^un J, 2m

<( _ !l f _

Or, using the values of 

m and R given on page 286, 

we qet 



we get 



This result implies that 

an atom of a given substance 

should have a 

slightly LONGER period of vibration 

when it is near the sun than 

when it is near the earth, 

and hence a 

slightly LONGER wave-length 

and therefore 

its lines should be 

SHIFTED a little toward the 

RED end of the spectrum (see p. 292). 

This was a most unexpected result! 
and since the amount of shift 
was so slight, 

^Neglecting higher powers of A 

since p is very small 
(see the values of m and R on p. 286). 
296 



it made the experimental verification 
very difficult. 

For several years after 

Einstein announced this result (1917) 

experimental observations on this point 

were doubtful, 

and this caused many physicists 

to doubt the validity of the 

Einstein theory, 

in spite of its other triumphs, 

which we have already discussed. 

BUT FIN ALLY, in 1927, 

the very careful measurements 

made by Evershed 

definitely settled the issue 

IN FAVOR OF THE EINSTEIN THEORY. 

Furthermore, 

similar experiments were performed 

by W. S. Adams 

on the star known as 

the companion to Sirius, 

which has a relatively 

LARGE MASS and SMALL RADIUS, 
thus making the ratio 

S7- 1 +- 

eft r 

much larger than 

in the case of the sun (see p. 296) 

and therefore easier to observe 

experimentally. 

Here too 

the verdict was definitely 

IN FAVOR OF THE EINSTEIN THEORY! 

So that to-day 

297 



all physicists are agreed 
that the Einstein theory 
marks a definite step forward 
for: 

(1) IT EXPLAINED 
PREVIOUSLY KNOWN FACTS 
MORE ADEQUATELY THAN 
PREVIOUS THEORIES DID (seep. 103). 

(2) IT EXPLAINED FACTS 
NOT EXPLAINED AT ALL 
BY PREVIOUS THEORIES 

such as: 

(a) The Michelson-Morley experiment,* 

(b) the shift in the perihelion 

of Mercury (see Ch. XXXI), 

(c) the increase in mass of 

an electron when in motion. f 

(3) IT PREDICTED FACTS 

NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AT ALL- 

(a) The bending of a light ray 

when passing near the sun (see Ch. XXXII). 

(b) The shift of lines in 

the spectrum (see p. 296). 

(c) The identity of mass and energy, 
which/ in turn, 

led to the ATOMIC BOMB! 
(Seep. 318 ff.) 

And all this 
by using 

VERY FEW 

and 

*See Part I, "The Special Theory. 11 
tSee Chap. VIII. 

298 



VERY REASONABLE 
hypotheses (see p. 97), 
not in the slightest degree 
"far-fetched" or "forced." 

And what greater service 
can any physical theory 
render 
than this ! 

We trust that the reader 

has been led by this little book 

to have a sufficient insight 

into the issues involved, 

and to appreciate 

the great breadth and 

fundamental importance of 

THE EINSTEIN THEORY OF RELATIVITY! 



XXXV. SUMMARY. 

I. In the SPECIAL Relativity Theory 
it was shown that 
two different observers, 
may, under certain 
SPECIAL conditions, 
study the universe from their 
different points of view 
and yet obtain 

the SAME LAWS and the SAME FACTS. 

II. In the GENERAL Theory, 

this democratic result was found to 

hold also for 

ANY two observers, 

without regard to the 

special conditions mentioned in I. 

299 



III. To accomplish this 
Einstein introduced the 

PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE, 

by which 

the idea of a FORCE OF GRAVITY 

was replaced by 

the idea of the 

CURVATURE OF A SPACE. 

IV. The study of this curvature 
required the machinery of 

the TENSOR CALCULUS, 

by means of which 

the CURVATURE TENSOR was derived. 

V. This led immediately to 

the NEW LAW OF GRAVITATION 

which was tested by 

the THREE CRUCIAL PHENOMENA 

and found to work beautifully!

THE MORAL 





. - 



THE MORAL 

Since man has been 
so successful in science, 
can we not learn from 

THE SCIENTIFIC WAY OF THINKING, 
what the human mind is capable of, 
and HOW it achieves SUCCESS: 

There is NOTHING ABSOLUTE in science. 

Absolute space and absolute time 

have been shown to be myths. 

We must replace these old ideas 

by more human, 

OBSERVATIONAL concepts. 



303 



c 




II. But what we observe is 
profoundly influenced by 
the state of the observer, 
and therefore 
various observers get 
widely different results 
even in their measurements of 
time and length! 

Ill However, 

in spite of these differences, 
various observers may still 
study the universe 
WITH EQUAL RIGHT 
AND EQUAL SUCCESS, 
and CAN AGREE on 
what are to be called 
the LAWS of the universe. 



305 



IV. To accomplish this we need 
MORE MATHEMATICS 
THAN EVER BEFORE, 
MODERN, STREAMLINED, POWERFUL 
MATHEMATICS. 



307 



V. Thus a combination of 
PRACTICAL REALISM 
(OBSERVATIONALISM) 
and 

IDEALISM (MATHEMATICS), 
TOGETHER 
have achieved SUCCESS. 

VI. And 

knowing that the laws are 

MAN-MADE, 

we know that 

they are subject to change 

and we are thus 

PREPARED FOR CHANGE, 

But these changes in science 

are NOT made WANTONLY, 

BUT CAREFULLY AND CAUTIOUSLY 

by the 

BEST MINDS and HONEST HEARTS, 

and not by any casual child who 

thinks that 

the world may be changed as easily 

as rolling off a log.

III. HOW TO JUDGE 

WHETHER A SET OF QUANTITIES 
IS A TENSOR 9R NOT: 

We may apply various criteria: 

(1) See if it satisfies any of 
the definitions of tensors of 
various character and rank 
given in (1 6), (1 7), (1 8), etc., 
or in (30), (31), etc. 

or in (32), etc. 
Or 

(2) See if it is the 

sum, difference, or product 
of two tensors. 
Or 

(3) See if it satisfies 

the following theorem: 

A QUANTITY WHICH 

ON INNER MULTIPLICATION 

BY ANY COVARIANT VECTOR 

(OR ANY CONTRAVARIANT VECTOR) 

ALWAYS GIVES A TENSOR, 

IS ITSELF A TENSOR. 

This theorem may be 

quite easily proved 

as follows: 

Given that XA a is known to be 

a contravariant vector, 

for any choice of 

the covariant vector A a / 

To prove that X is a tensor: 

Now since XA a is 

a contravariant vector, 

it must obey (16), thus: 

(X Aft) = (XA a ); 
312 



but A' s = X y 



hence, by substitution, 

yr Af _ dx,; dXfl Ary 
A /A/9 \ ' ^ /i/sA 

dx y ox a 
or 

j/ /y/ 3x 5 3x^ y\ _ ^ 
S\0 VA TV~~ "^ A I v, 

6x T 3x a 

But /A^ does not have to be zero, 
hence 

XI _ C'X^ C/X0 y 
~ ' ^ A 
ax T ox a 

which satisfies (1 7), 
thus proving that 
X must be a 

CONTRAVARIANT TENSOR 
OF RANK TWO. 

And similarly for other cases: 

Thus if XA = B, y 

then X must be a tensor of 

the form C^ / 

and if XA* = C rp / 

then X must be a tensor of 

the form B a arp , 

and so on. 

Now let us show that 
the set of little g's in (42) 
is a tensor: 

313 



Knowing that c/s 2 is a 

SCALAR - 

i.e. A TENSOR OF RANK ZERO 

(see p. 128), 

then 

the right-hand member of (42) is also 

A TENSOR OF RANK ZERO/ 

but c/x, is, by (1 5) on p. 1 52, 

A CONTRAVARIANT VECTOR, 

hence, 

by the theorem on page 312, 

g MI , dx^ must be 

A COVARIANT TENSOR 

OF RANK ONE. 

And, again, 

since C/X M is 

a contravariant vector, 

then, 

by the same theorem, 

g^ must be 

A COVARIANT TENSOR 
OF RANK TWO, 

and therefore 

it is appropriate to write it 

with TWO SUBscripts 

as we have been doing 

in anticipation of 

this proof. 



314 



IV. WHY MASS CAN BE EXPRESSED IN 
KILOMETERS: 

The reader may be surprised to 

see the mass expressed in kilometers! 

But it may seem more reasonable" 

from the following considerations: 

In order to decide in what units 

a quantity is expressed 

we must consider its "dimensionality 14 

in terms of the fundamental units of 

Mass, Length, and Time: 

Thus the "dimensionality" of 

a velocity is L/T; 

the "dimensionality" of 

an acceleration is i/7 2 ; 

and so on. 

Now, in Newtonian physics, 

the force of attraction which 

the sun exerts upon the earth 

being F = fcmm'/f 2 (see p. 219), 

where m is the mass of the sun, 

m the mass of the earth, 

and r the distance between them; 

and also, F m j, 

j being the centripetal acceleration 

of the earth toward the sun 

(another one of the fundamental 

laws of Newtonian mechanics); 

hence 

fcmm' _ ,. 

2 m j 



2- 

or m = v r i. 

Therefore, 

315 



the "dimensionality" of m is 
,, L = V 

L 'r p 

since a constant, like V, 

has no "dimensionality/* 

And now 

if we take as a unit of time/ 

the time it takes light to go 

a distance of one kilometer/ 

and call this unit 

a M kilometer n of time 

(thus 300/000 kilometers would 

equal one second/ since 

light goes 300/000 kilometers in 

one second)/ 

then we may express 

the "dimensionality" of m thus: 

L 3 /T 2 or simply / 

thus we may express 

mass also in kilometers. 

So far as considerations of 

"dimensionality" are concerned/ 

the same result holds true also for 

Einsteinian physics. 

If the reader has never before 

encountered this idea of 

"dimensionality" 

(which, by the way, is a very 

important tool in scientific thinking), 

he will enjoy reading a paper on 

"Dimensional Analysis" by 

Dr. A. N. Lowan, 

published by 

the Galois Institute of Mathematics 

of Long Island University in 

Brooklyn, N. Y.

THE ATOMIC BOMB 

We saw on p. 78 that the energy 
which a body has when at rest, is: 



fo = me 



Thus, the Theory of Relativity 

tells us not only that 

mass and energy are one and the same 

but that, even though they are the same 

still/ what we consider to be 

even a SMALL MASS is 

ENORMOUS when translated into ENERGY terms, 

so that a mass as tiny as an atom 

has a tremendous amount of energy 

the multiplying factor being c 2 , 
the square of the velocity of light! 

How to get at this great storehouse of 

energy locked up in atoms 

and use it to heat our homes, 

to drive our cars and planes, 

and so on and so on? 

Now, so long as m is constant, 

as for elastic collision, 

fo will also remain unchanged. 

But, for inelastic collision, 

m , and therefore Fo , will change; 

and this is the situation when 

AN ATOM IS SPLIT UP, for then 

the sum of the masses of the parts 

is LESS than the mass of the original atom. 

Thus, if one could split atoms, 

the resulting loss of mass would 

release a tremendous amount of energy! 

And so various methods were devised 

by scientists like Meitner, Frisch, 

Fermi, and others 

318 



to "bombard 11 atoms. 

It was Finally shown that when 

Uranium atoms were bombarded with neutrons* 

these atoms split up ("fission") 

into two nearly equal parts, 

whose combined mass is less than 

the mass of the uranium atom itself, 

this loss in mass being equivalent, 

as the Einstein formula shows, 

to a tremendous amount of energy, 

thus released by the fission! 

When Einstein warned President Roosevelt 

that such experiments might lead to 

the acquisition of terrific new sources of power 

by the ENEMY of the human race, 

the President naturally saw the importance 

of having these experiments conducted 

where there was some hope that 

they would be used to END the war 

and to PREVENT future wars 

instead of by those who set out to 

take over the earth for themselves alone! 

Thus the ATOMIC BOMB 
was born in the U.S.A. 

And now that a practical method 
of releasing this energy 
has been developed, 
the MORAL is obvious: 
We MUST realize that it has become 
too dangerous to fool around with 
scientific GADGETS, 
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING 
the MORALITY which is in

SAM, for short. 

These are NOT mere 

idle words. 

We must ROOT OUT the 

FALSE AND DANGEROUS DOCTRINE 

that SAM is amoral 

and is indifferent to 

Good and Evil. 

We must 

SERIOUSLY EXAMINE SAM 

FROM THIS VIEWPOINT.* 

Religion has offered us 
a Morality, 

but many u wise guys lc have 
refused to take it 
seriously, 

and have distorted its 
meaning! 

And now, we are getting 
ANOTHER CHANCE- 
SAM is now also 
warning us that 
we MUST 

UNDERSTAND the MORALITY which 
HE is now offering us. 
And he will not stand for 
our failure to accept it, 
by regarding him merely as 
a source of gadgets! 
Even using the atomic energy 
for "peaceful" pursuits,

of this vital point.

like heating the furnaces in 

our homes/ 

IS NOT ENOUGH, 

and will NOT satisfy SAM. 

For he is desperately trying 

to prevent us from 

merely picking his pockets 

to get at the gadgets in them/ 

and is begging us to see 

the Good/ the True, and 

the Beautiful 

which are in his mind and heart, 

And, moreover, 

he is giving 

new and clear meanings to 

these fine old ideas 1 

which even the sceptical 

"wise guys 11 

will find irresistible. 

So 

DO NOT BE AN 

ANTI-SAMITE, 

or SAM will get you 

with his 

atomic bombs, 

his cyclotrons/ 

and all his new 

whatnots. 

He is so anxious to HELP us 

if only we would listen 

BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!
